The History of the Common Law of England


 by Matthew Hale

 1713  


 I. Concerning the Distribution of the Law of England into Common  Law, and Statute Law. And First, concerning the Statute Law, or  Acts of Parliament          The Laws of England may aptly enough be divided into two  Kinds, viz. Lex Scripta, the written Law: and Lex non Scripta,  the unwritten Law: For although (as shall be shewn hereafter) all  the Laws of this Kingdom have some Monuments or Memorials thereof  in Writing, yet all of them have not their Original in Writing;  for some of those Laws have obtain'd their Force by immemorial  Usage or Custom, and such Laws are properly call'd Leges non  Scriptae, or unwritten Laws or Customs.      Those Laws therefore, that I call Leges Scriptae, or written  Laws, are such as are usually called Statute Laws, or Acts of  Parliament, which are originally reduced into Writing before they  are enacted, or receive any binding Power, every such Law being  in the first Instance formally drawn up in Writing, and made, as  it were, a Tripartite lndenture, between the King, the Lords and  the Commons; for without the concurrent Consent of all those  Three Parts of the Legislature, no such Law is, or can be made:  But the Kings of this Realm, with the Advice and Consent of both  Houses of Parliament, have Power to make New Laws, or to alter,  repeal, or enforce the Old. And this has been done in all  Succession of Ages.      Now, Statute Laws, or Acts of Parliament, are of Two Kinds,  viz. First, Those Statutes which were made before Time of Memory;  and, Secondly, Those Statutes which were made within or since  Time of Memory; wherein observe, That according to a juridical  Account and legal Signification, Time within Memory is the Time  of Limitation in a Writ of Right; which by the Statute of  Westminster 1. cap. 38. was settled, and reduced to the Beginning  of the Reign of King Richard I or Ex prima Coronatione Regis  Richardi Primi, who began his Reign the 6th of July 1189, and was  crown'd the 3d of September following: So that whatsoever was  before that Time, is before Time of Memory; and what is since  that Time, is, in a legal Sense, said to be within or since the  Time of Memory.      And therefore it is, that those Statutes or Acts of  Parliament that were made before the Beginning of the Reign of  King Richard I and have not since been repealed or altered,  either by contrary Usage, or by subsequent Acts of Parliament,  are now accounted Part of the Lex non Scripta, being as it were  incorporated thereinto, and become a Part of the Common Law; and  in Truth, such Statutes are not now pleadable as Acts of  Parliament, (because what is before Time of Memory is supposed  without a Beginning, or at least such a Beginning as the Law  takes Notice of) but they obtain their Strength by meer  immemorial Usage or Custom.      And doubtless, many of those Things that now obtain as Common  Law, had their Original by Parliamentary Acts or Constitutions,  made in Writing by the King, Lords and Commons; though those Acts  are now either not extant, or if extant, were made before Time of  Memory; and the Evidence of the Truth hereof will easily appear,  for that in many of those old Acts of Parliament that were made  before Time of Memory, and are yet extant, we many find many of  those Laws enacted which now obtain merely as Common Law, or the  General Custom of the Realm: And were the rest of those Laws  extant, probably the Footsteps of the Original Institution of  many more Laws that now obtain meerly as Common Law, or Customary  Laws, by immemorial Usage, would appear to have been at first  Statute Laws, or Acts of Parliament.      Those ancient Acts of Parliament which are ranged under the  Head of Leges non Scriptae, or Customary Laws, as being made  before Time of Memory, are to be considered under Two Periods:  Viz. First, Such as were made before the coming in of King  William I commonly called, The Conqueror; or, Secondly, Such as  intervened between his coming in, and the Beginning of the Reign  of Richard I which is the legal Limitation of Time of Memory.      The former Sort of these Laws are mentioned by our ancient  Historians, especially by Brompton, and are now collected into  one Volume by William Lambard, Esq; in his Tractatus de priscis  Anglorum Legibus, being a Collection of the Laws of the Kings,  Ina, Alfred, Edward, Athelstane, Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred,  Canutus, and of Edward te Confessor; which last Body of Laws,  compiled by Edward the Confessor, as they were more full and  perfect than the rest, and better accommodated to the then State  of Things, so they were such whereof the English were always very  zealous, as being the great Rule and Standard of their Rights and  Liberties: Whereof more hereafter.      The second Sort are those Edicts, Acts of Parliament, or  Laws, that were made after the coming in of King William,  commonly named, The Conqueror, and before the beginning of the  Reign of King Richard I and more especially are those which  follow; whereof I shall make but a brief Remembrance here,  because it will be necessary in the Sequel of this Discourse (it  may be more than once) to resume the Mention of them; and  besides, Mr Selden, in his Book called, Janus Anglorum, has given  a full Account of those Laws; so that at present it will be  sufficient for me, briefly to collect the Heads or Divisions of  them, under the Reigns of those several Kings wherein they were  made, viz.      First, The Laws of King William I. These consisted in a great  Measure of the Repetition of the Laws of King Edward the  Confessor, and of the enforcing them by his own Authority, and  the Assent of Parliament, at the Request of the English; and some  new Laws were added by himself with the like Assent of  Parliament, relating to Military Tenures, and the Preservation of  the publick Peace of the Kingdom; all which are mention'd by Mr  Lambert, in the Tractate before-mentioned, but more fully by Mr  Selden, in his Collections and Observations upon Eadmerus.      Secondly, We find little of new Laws after this, till the  Time of King Henry I, who besides the Confirmation of the Laws of  the Confessor, and of King William I brought in a new Volume of  Laws, which to this Day are extant, and called the Laws of King  Henry I. The entire Collection of these is entered in the Red  Book of the Exchequer, and from thence are transcribed and  published by the Care of Sir Roger Twisden, in the latter End of  Mr Lambart's Book before-mention'd; what the Success of those  Laws were in the Time of King Steven, and King Henry 2 we shall  see hereafter: But they did not much obtain in England, and are  now for the most Part become wholly obsolete, and in Effect quite  antiquated.      Thirdly, The next considerable Body of Acts of Parliament,  were those made under the Reign of King Henry 2 commonly called,  The Constitiutions of Clarendon; what they were, appears best in  Hoveden and Mat. Paris, under the years of that King. We have  little Memory else of any considerable Laws enacted in this  King's Time, except his Assizes, and such Laws as related to the  Forests; which were afterwards improv'd under the Reign of King  Richard I. But of this hereafter, more at large.      And this shall serve for a short Instance of those Statutes,  or Acts of Parliament, that were made before Time of Memnory;  whereof, as we have no Authentical Records, but only Transcripts,  either in our ancient Historians, or other Books and Manuscripts;  so they being Things done before Time of Memory, obtain at this  Day no further than as by Usage and Custom they are, as it were,  engrafted into the Body of the Common Law, and made a Part  thereof.      And now I come to those Leges Scriptae, or Acts of  Parliament, which were made since or within the Time of Memory,  viz. Since the Beginning of the Reign of Richard I and those I  shall divide into Two General Heads, viz. Those we usually call  the Old Statutes, and those we usually call the New or later  Statutes: And because I would prefix some certain Time or  Boundary between them, I shall call those the Old Statutes which  end with the Reign of King Edward 2 and those I shall call the  New or later Statutes which begin with the Reign of King Edward 3  and so are derived through a Succession of Kings and Queens down  to this Day, by a continued and orderly Series.      Touching these later Sort I shall say nothing, for they all  keep an orderly and regular Series of Time, and are extant upon  Record, either in the Parliament Rolls, or in the Statute Rolls  of King Edward 3 and those Kings that follow: For excepting some  few years in the Beginning of K. Edward 3. i.e. 2, 3, 7, 8 & 9  Edw. 3. all the Parliament Rolls that ever were since that Time  have been preserved, and are extant; and, for the most Part, the  Petitions upon which the Acts were drawn up, or the very Acts  themselves.      Now therefore touching the elder Acts of Parliament, viz.  Those that were made between the First Year of the Reign of K.  Richard I and the last year of K. Edward 2 we have little extant  in any authentical History; and nothing in any authentical Record  touching Acts made in the Time of K. Rich. I unless we take in  those Constitutions and Assizes mentioned by Hoveden as  aforesaid.      Neither is there any great Evidence, what Acts of Parliament  pass'd in the Time of King John, tho' doubtless many there were  both in his Time, and in the Time of K. Rich. I. But there is no  Record extant of them, and the English Histories of those Times  give us but little Account of those Laws; only Matthew Paris  gives us an Historical Account of the Magna Charta, and Charta de  Foresta, granted by King John at Running Mead the 15th of June,  in the Seventeenth Year of his Reign.      And it seems, that the Concession of these Charters was in a  Parliamentary Way; you may see the Transcripts of both Charters  verbatim in Mat. Paris, and in the Red Book of the Exchequer.  There were seven Pair of these Charters sent to some of the Great  Monasteries under the Seal of King John, one Part whereof sent to  the Abby of Tewkesbury I have seen under the Seal of that King;  the Substance thereof differs something from the Magna Charta,  and Charta de Foresta, granted by King Henry 3 but not very much,  as may appear by comparing them.      But tho' these Charters of King John seem to have been passed  in a kind of Parliament, yet it was in a Time of great Confusion  between that King and his Nobles; and therefore they obtained not  a full Settlement till the Time of King Henry 3 when the  Substance of them was enacted by a full and solemn Parliament.      I therefore come down to the Times of those succeeding Kings,  Henry 3. Edw. I. and Edw. 2. and the Statutes made in the Times  of those Kings, I call the Old Statutes; partly because many of  them were made but in Affirmance of the Common Law; and partly  because the rest of them, that made a Change in the Common Law,  are yet so ancient, that they now seem to have been as it were a  Part of the Common Law, especially considering the many  Expositions that have been made of them in the several  Successions of Times, whereby as they became the great Subject of  Judicial Resolutions and Decisions; so those Expositions and  Decisions, together also with those old Statutes themselves, are  as it were incorporated into the very Common Law, and become a  Part of it.      In the Times of those three Kings last mentioned, as likewise  in the Times of their Predecessors, there were doubtless many  more Acts of Parliament made than are now extant of Record, or  otherwise, which might be a Means of the Change of the Common Law  in the Times of those Kings from what it was before, tho' all the  Records of Memorials of those Acts of Parliament introducing such  a Change, are not at this Day extant: But of those that are  extant, I shall give you a brief Account, not intending a large  or accurate Treatise touching that matter.      The Reign of Henry 3 was a troublesome Time, in respect of  the Differences between him and his Barons, which were not  composed till his 51st year, after the Battle of Evesham. In his  Time there were many Parliaments, but we have only one Summons of  Parliament extant of Record in his Reign, viz. 49 Henry 3. and we  have but few of those many Acts of Parliament that passed in his  Time, viz. The great Charter, and Charta de Foresta, in the Ninth  year of his Reign, which were doubtless pass'd in Parliament; the  Statute of Merton, in the 20th year of his Reign; the Statute of  Marlbridge, in the 52d year. and the Dictum sive Edictum de  Kenelworth, about the same Time; and some few other old Acts.      In the Time of K. Edw. I. there are many more Acts of  Parliament extant than in the Time of K. Henry 3. Yet doubtless,  in this King's Time, there were many more Statutes made than are  now extant: Those that are now extant, are commonly bound  together in the old Book of Magna Charta. By those Statutes,  great Alterations and Amendments were made in the Common Law; and  by those that are now extant, we may reasonably guess, that there  were considerable Alterations and Amendments made by those that  are not extant, which possibly may be the real, tho' sudden Means  of the great Advance and Alteration of the Laws of England in  this King's Reign, over what they were in the Time of his  Predecessors.      The first Summons of Parliament that I remember extant of  Record in this King's Time, is 23 Edw. I. tho' doubtless there  were many more before this, the Records whereof are either lost  or mislaid: For many Parliaments were held by this King before  that Time, and many of the Acts pass'd in those Parliaments are  still extant; as, the Statutes of Westminster I. in the 3d of  Edw. I. The Statutes of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I. The Statutes of  Westminster 2. and of Winton, 1 3 Edw. I. The Statutes of  Westminster 3. and of Quo Warranto, 18 Edw. I. And divers others  in other years, which I shall have Occasion to mention hereafter.        In the Time of K. Edw. 2. many Parliaments were held, and  many Laws were enacted; but we have few Acts of Parliament of his  Reign extant, especially of Record.      And now, because I intend to give some short Account of some  general Observations touching Parliaments, and of Acts of  Parliament pass'd in the Times of those three Princes, viz. Henry  3. Edw. I. and Edw. 2. because they are of greatest Antiquity,  and therefore the Circumstances that atended them most liable to  be worn out by Process of Time, I will here mention some  Particulars relating to them to preserve their Memory, and which  may also be useful to be known in relation to other Things.      We are therefore to know, That there are these several Kinds  of Records of Things done in Parliament, or especially relating  thereto, viz. I. The Summons to Parliament. 2. The Rolls of  Parliament. 3. Bundles of Petitions in Parliament. 4. The  Statutes, or Acts of Parliament themselves. And, 5. The Brevia de  Parliamento, which for the most part were such as issued for the  Wages of Knights and Burgesses; but with these I shall not  meddle.      First, as to the Summons to Parliament. These Summons to  Parliament are not all entred of Record in the Times of Henry 3  and Edw. I. none being extant of Record in the Time of Hen. 3.  but that of 49 Hen. 3. and none in the Time of Edw. I. till the  23 Edw. I. But after that year, they are for the most part extant  of Record, viz. In Dorso Claius' Rotulorum, in the Backside of  the Close Rolls.      Secondly, As to the Rolls of Parliament, viz. The Entry of  the several Petitions, Answers and Transactions in Parliament.  Those are generally and successively extant of Record in the  Tower, from 4 Edw. 3. downward till the End of the Reign of Edw.  4. Excepting only those Parliaments that intervened between the  1st and the 4th, and between the 6th and the 11th, of Edw. 3.      But of those Rolls in the Times of Hen. 3. and Edw. I. and  Edw. 2. many are lost and few extant; also, of the Time of Henry  3. I have not seen any Parliament Roll; and all that I ever saw  of the Time of Edw. I. was one Roll of Parliament in the Receipt  of the Exchequer of 18 Edw. I. and those Proceedings and  Remembrances which are in the Liber placitor' Parliamenti in the  Tower, beginning, as I remember, with the 20th year of Edw. I.  and ending with the Parliament of Carlisle, 35 Edw. I and not  continued between those years with any constant Series; but  including some Remembrances of some Parliaments in the Time of  Edw. I. and others in the Time of Edw. 2.      In the Time of Edw. 2. besides the Rotulus Ordinationum, of  the Lords Ordoners, about 7 Edw. 2. we have little more than the  Parliament Rolls of 7 & 8 Edw. 2. and what others are  interspersed in the Parliament Book of Edw. I. above mentioned,  and, as I remember, some short Remembrances of Things done in  Parliament in the 19 Edw. 3.      Thirdly, As to the Bundles of Petitions in Parliament. They  were for the most part Petitions of private Persons, and are  commonly endorsed with Remissions to the several Courts where  they were properly determinable. There are many of those Bundles  of Petitions, some in the Times of Edw. I. and Edw. 2 and more in  the Times of Edw. 3. and the Kings that succeeded him.      Fourthly, The Statutes, or Acts of Parliament themselves.  These seem, as if in the Time of Edw. I. they were drawn up into  the Form of a Law in the first Instance, and so assented to by  both Houses, and the King, as may appear by the very Observation  of the Contexture and Fabrick of the Statutes of those Times. But  from near the Beginning of the Reign of Edw. 3. till very near  the End of Hen. 6. they were not in the first Instance drawn up  in the Form of Acts of Parliament; but the Petition and the  Answer were entred in the Parliament Rolls, and out of both, by  Advice of the Judges, and others of the King's Council, the Act  was drawn up conformable to the Petition and Answer, and the Act  itself for the most part entred in a Roll, called, The Statute  Roll, and the Tenor thereof affixed to Proclamation Writs,  directed to the several Sheriffs to proclaim it as a Law in their  respective Counties.      But because sometimes Difficulties and Troubles arose, by  this extracting of the Statute out of the Petition and Answer;  about the latter End of Hen. 6. and Beginning of Edward 4. they  took a Course to reduce 'em, even in the first Instance, into the  full and compleat Form of Acts of Parliament, which was  prosecuted (or Entred) commonly in this Form: Item quaedam  Petitio exhibita fuit in hoc Parliamento forman actus in se  continens, &c. and abating that Stile, the Method still continues  much the same, namely; That the entire Act is drawn up in Form,  and so comes to the King for his assent.      The ancient Method of passing Acts of Parliament being thus  declared, I shall now give an Account touching those Acts of  Parliament that are at this Day extant of the Times of Henry 3.  Edw. I. and Edw. 2. and they are of two Sorts, viz. Some of them  are extant of Record; others are extant in ancient Books and  Memorials, but none of Record. And those which are extant of  Record, are either Recorded in the proper and natural Roll, viz.  the Statiute Roll: or they are entred in some other Roll,  especially in the Close Rolls and Patent Rolls, or in both. Those  that are extant, but not of Record, are such as tho' they have no  Record extant of them, but possibly the same is lost; yet they  are preserved in ancient Books and Monuments. and in all Times  have had the Reputation and Authority of Acts of Parliament.      For an Act of Parliament made within Time of Memory, loses  not its being so, because not extant of Record, especially if it  be a general Act of Parliament. For of general Acts of  Parliament, the Courts of Common Law are to take Notice without  pleading of them; and such acts shall never be put to be tried by  the Record, upon an Issue of Nul tiel Record. but it shall be  tried by the Court, who, if there be any Difficulty or  Uncertainty touching it or the right Pleading of it, are to use  for their Information ancient Copies, Transcripts, Books,  Pleadings and Memorials to inform themselves, but not to admit  the same to be put in Issue by a Plea of Niul tiel Record.      For, as shall be shewn hereafter, there are very many old  Statutes which are admitted and obtain as such, tho' there be no  Record at this Day extant thereof, nor yet any other written  Evidence of the same, but what is in a manner only Traditional,  as namely, Ancient and Modern Books of Pleadings, and the common  receiv'd Opinion and Reputation, and the Approbation of the  Judges Learned in the Laws: For the Judges and Courts of Justice  are, ex Officio, (bound) to take Notice of publick Acts of  Parliament, and whether they are truly pleaded or not, and  therefore they are the Triers of them. But it is otherwise of  private Acts of Parliament, for they may be put in Issue, and  tried by the Record upon Nul tiel Record pleaded, unless they are  produced exemplified, as was done in the Prince's Cafe in my Lord  Coke's 8th Rep. and therefore the Averment of Nul tiel Record was  refused in that Case.      The old Statutes or Acts of Parliament that are of Record, as  is before said, are entred either upon the proper Statute Roll,  or some other Roll in Chancery.      The first Statute Roll which we have, is in the Tower, and  begins with Magna Charta, and ends with Edw. 3. and is called  Magnus Rotulus Statutor'. There are five other Statute Rolls in  that Office, of the Times of Richard 2. Henry 4. Hen. 5. Hen. 6.  and Edw. 4.      I shall now give a Scheme of those ancient Statutes of the  Times of Henry 3. Edw. I. and Edw. 2. that are recorded in the  first of those Rolls or elsewhere, to the best of my Remembrance,  and according to those Memorials I have long had by me, viz.        Magna Charta.

According to a strict Inquiry made about 30 years since,  these were all the old Statutes of the Times of Hen. 3. Edw. I.  and Edw. 2. that were then to be found of Record; what other  Statutes have been found since, I know not.      The Ordinance called Butler's, for the Heir to punish Waste  in the Life of the Ancestor, tho' it be of Record in the  Parliament Book of Edw. I yet it never was a Statute, nor never  so received, but only some Constitution of the King's Council or  Lords in Parliament, and which never obtain'd the Strength or  Force of an Act of Parliament.      Now those Statutes that ensue, tho' most of 'em are  unquestionable Acts of Parliament, yet are not of Record that I  know of, but only their Memorials preserved in ancient Printed  and Manuscript Books of Statutes; yet they are at this Day for  the most part generally accepted and taken as Acts of Parliament,  tho' some of 'em are now antiquated and of little Use, viz.        The Statutes of Merton, Marlbridge, Westm. I. Explanatio  Statuti Gloucestriae, De Champertio, De visu Frankplegii, De pane  & Cervisia, Articuli Inquisitionis super Stat. de Winton,  Circumspecte agatis, De districtione Scaccarii, De  Conspirationibus, De vocatis ad Warrant.

Statut. de Gavelet, De Militibus, De Vasto,  De anno Bissextili, De appellatis, De Extenta Manerii, Compositio  Mensearum vel Computatio Mensarum. Stat. de Quo Warranto,  Ordinatio de Inquisitionibus, Ordinatio de Foresta, De admensura  Terre, De dimissione Denarior. Statut. de Quo Warranto novum, Ne  Rector prosternat arbores in Caemeterio, Consuetudines & Assisa  de Foresta, Compositio de Ponderibus, De Tallagio, De visu Terrae  & servitio Regis, Compositio ulnarum & particarum, De Terris  amortizandis, Dictum de Kenelworth, &c.        From whence we may collect these Two observations, viz.        First, That altho' the Record itself be not extant, yet  general Statutes made within Time of Memory, namely, since I  Richardi Primi, do not lose their Strength, if any authentical  Memorials thereof are in Books, and seconded with a general  receiv'd Tradition attesting and approving the same.        Secondly, That many Records, even of Acts of Parliament, have  in long Process of Time been lost, and possibly the Things  themselves forgotten at this Day, which yet in or near the Times  wherein they were made, might cause many of those authoritative  Alterations in some Things touching the Proceedings and Decisions  in Law: The Original Cause of which Change being otherwise at  this Day hid and unknown to us; and indeed, Histories (and  Annals) give us an Account of the Suffrages of many Parliaments,  whereof we at this Time have none, or few Footsteps extant in  Records or Acts of Parliament. The Instance of the great  Parliament at Oxford, about 40th of Henry 3. may, among many  others of like Nature, be a concurrent Evidence of this: For tho'  we have Mention made in our Histories of many Constitutions made  in the said Parliament at Oxford, and which occasioned much  Trouble in the Kingdom, yet we have no Monuments of Record  concerning that Parliament, or what those Constitutions were.        And thus much shall serve touching those Old Statutes or  Leges Scriptae, or Acts of Parliament made in the Times of those  three Kings, Henry 3. Edw. I. and Edw. 2. Those that follow in  the Times of Edw. 3. and the succeeding Kings, are drawn down in  a continued Series of Time, and are extant of Record in the  Parliament Rolls, and in the Statute Rolls, without any  remarkable Omission, and therefore I shall say nothing of them.      II. Concerning the Lex non Scripta, i.e. The Common or Municipal  Laws of this Kingdom        In the former Chapter, I have given you a short Account of  that Part of the Laws of England which is called Lex Scripta,  namely, Statutes or Acts of Parliament, which in their original  Formation are reduced into Writing, and are so preserv'd in their  Original Form, and in the same Stile and Words wherein they were  first made: I now come to that Part of our Laws called, Lex non  Scripta, under which I include not only General Customs, or the  Common Law properly so called, but even those more particular  Laws and Customs applicable to certain Courts and Persons,  whereof more hereafter.      And when I call those Parts of our Laws Leges non Scriptae, I  do not mean as if all those Laws were only Oral, or communicated  from the former Ages to the later, merely by Word. For all those  Laws have their several Monuments in Writing, whereby they are  transferr'd from one Age to another, and without which they would  soon lose all kind of Certainty: For as the Civil and Canon Laws  have their Responsa Prudentum Consilia & Decisions, i.e. their  Canons, Decrees, and Decretal Determinations extant in Writing;  so those Laws of England which are not comprised under the Title  of Acts of Parliament, are for the most part extant in Records of  Pleas, Proceedings and Judgments, in Books of Reports, and  Judicial Decisions, in Tractates of Learned Men's Arguments and  Opinions, preserved from ancient Times, and still extant in  Writing.      But I therefore stile those Parts of the Law, Leges non  Scriptae, because their Authoritative and Original Institutions  are not set down in Writing in that Manner, or with that  Authority that Acts of Parliament are, but they are grown into  Use, and have acquired their binding Power and the Force of Laws  by a long and immemorial Usage, and by the Strength of Custom and  Reception in this Kingdom. The Matters indeed, and the Substance  of those Laws, are in Writing, but the formal and obliging Force  and Power of them grows by long Custom and Use, as will fully  appear in the ensuing Discourse.      For the Municipal Laws of this Kingdom, which I thus call  Leges non Scriptae, are of a vast Extant, and indeed include in  their Generality all those several Laws which are allowed, as the  Rule and Direction of Justice and Judicial Proceedings, and which  are applicable to all those various Subjects, about which Justice  is conversant. I shall, for more Order, and the better to guide  my Reader, distinguish them into Two Kinds, viz.        First, The Common Law, as it is taken in its proper and usual  Acceptation.      Secondly, Those particular Laws applicable to particular  subjects, Matters or Courts.        1. Touching the former, viz. The Common Law in its usual and  proper Acceptation. This is that Law by which Proceedings and  Determinations in the King's Ordinary Courts of Justice are  directed and guided. This directs the Course of Discents of  Lands, and the Kinds; the Natures, and the Extents and  Qualifications of Estates; therein also the Manner, Forms,  Ceremonies and Solemnities of transferring Estates from one to  another. The Rules of Settling, Acquiring, and Transferring of  Properties; The Forms, Solemnities and Obligation of Contracts;  The Rules and Directions for the Exposition of Wills, Deeds and  Acts of Parliament. The Process, Proceedings, Judgments and  Executions of the King's Ordinary Courts of Justice; The Limits,  Bounds and Extents of Courts, and their Jurisdictions. The  several Kinds of Temporal Offences, and Punishments at Common  Law. and the Manner of the Application of the several Kinds of  Punishments, and infinite more Particulars which extend  themselves as large as the many Exigencies in the Distribution of  the King's Ordinary Justice requires.      And besides these more common and ordinary Matters to which  the Common Law extends, it likewise includes the Laws applicable  to divers Matters of very great Moment; and tho' by Reason of  that Application, the said Common Law assumes divers  Denominations, yet they are but Branches and Parts of it; like as  the same Ocean, tho' it many times receives a different Name from  the Province, Shire, Island or Country to which it is contiguous,  yet these are but Parts of the same Ocean.      Thus the Common Law includes, Lex Prerogativa, as 'tis  applied with certain Rules to that great Business of the King's  Prerogative; so 'tis called Lex Forestae, as it is applied under  its special and proper Rules to the Business of Forests; so it is  called Lex Mercatoria. as it is applied under its proper Rules to  the Business of Trade and Commerce; and many more instances of  like Nature may be given: Nay, the various and particular Customs  of Cities, Towns and Manors, are thus far Parts of the Common  Law, as they are applicable to those particular Places, which  will appear from these Observations, viz.      First, The Common Law does determine what of those Customs  are good and reasonable, and what are unreasonable and void.  Secondly, The Common Law gives to those Customs, that it adjudges  reasonable, the Force and Efficacy of their Obligation. Thirdly,  The Common Law determines what is that Continuance of Time that  is sufficient to make such a Custom. Fourthly, The Common Law  does interpose and authoritatively decide the Exposition, Limits  and Extension of such Customs.      This Common Law, though the Usage, Practice and Decisions of  the King's Courts of Justice may expound and evidence it, and be  of great Use to illustrate and explain it; yet it cannot be  authoritatively altered or changed but by Act of Parliament. But  of this Common Law, and the Reason of its Denomination, more at  large hereafter.      Now, Secondly, As to those particular Laws I before  mentioned, which are applicable to particular Matters, Subjects  or Courts: These make up the second Branch of the Laws of  England, which I include under the general Term of Leges non  ScriPtae. and by those particular Laws I mean the Laws  Ecclesiastical, and the Civil Law, so far forth as they are  admitted in certain Courts, and certain Matters allow'd to the  Decision of those Courts, whereof hereafter.      It is true, That those Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws are  indeed Written Laws; the Civil Law being contain'd in their  Pandects, and the Institutions of Justinian, &c. (their Imperial  Constitutions or Codes answering to our Leges ScriPtae, or  Statutes.) And the Canon or Ecclesiastical Laws contain'd for the  most part in the Canons and Constitutions of Councils and Popes,  collected in their Decretum Gratiani, and the Decretal Epistles  of Popes, which make up the Body of their Corpus Juris Canonici,  together with huge Volumes of Councils and Expositions,  Decisions, and Tractates of learned Civilians and Canonists,  relating to both Laws; so that it may seem at first View very  improper to rank these under the Branch of Leges non ScriPtae, or  Unwritten Laws.      But I have for the following Reason rang'd these Laws among  the Unwritten Laws of England, viz. because it is most plain,  That neither the Canon Law nor the Civil Law have any Obligation  as Laws within this Kingdom, upon any Account that the Popes or  Emperors made those Laws, Canons, Rescripts or Determinations, or  because Justinian compiled their CorPus Juris Civilis, and by his  Edicts confirm'd and publish'd the same as authentical, or  because this or that Council or Pope made those or these Canons  or Degrees, or because Gratian, or Gregory, or Boniface, or  Clement, did, as much as in them lie, authenticate this or that  Body of Canons or Constitutions; for the King of England does not  recognize any Foreign Authority as superior or equal to him in  this Kingdom, neither do any Laws of the Pope or Emperor, as they  are such, bind here: But all the Strength that either the Papal  or Imperial Laws have obtained in this Kingdom, is only because  they have been received and admitted either by the Consent of  Parliament, and so are Part of the Statute Laws of the Kingdom,  or else by immemorial Usage and Custom in some particular Cases  and Courts, and no otherwise; and therefore so far as such Laws  are received and allowed of here, so far they obtain and no  farther. and the Authority and Force they have here is not  founded on, or derived from themselves; for so they bind no more  with us than our Laws bind in Rome or Italy. But their Authority  is founded merely on their being admitted and received by us,  which alone gives 'em their Authoritative Essence, and qualifies  their Obligation.      And hence it is, That even in those Courts where the Use of  those Laws is indulged according to that Reception which has been  allowed, em: If they exceed the Bounds of that Reception, by  extending themselves to other Matters than has been allowed 'em;  or if those Courts proceed according to that Law, when it is  controuled by the Common Law of the Kingdom: The Common Law does  and may prohibit and punish them; and it will not be a sufficient  Answer, for them to tell the King's Courts, that Justinian or  Pope Gregory have decreed otherwise. For we are not bound by  their Decrees further, or otherwise than as the Kingdom here has,  as it were transposed the same into the Common and Municipal Laws  of the Realm, either by Admission of, or by Enacting the same,  which is that alone which can make, em of any Force in England. I  need not give particular Instances herein; the Truth thereof is  plain and evident, and we need go no further than the Statutes of  24 H. 8. cap. 12. 25 H. 8. c. 19, 20, 21, and the learned Notes  of Selden upon Fleta, and the Records there cited; nor shall I  spend much Time touching the Use of those Laws in the several  Courts of this Kingdom: But will only briefly mention some few  Things concerning them.      There are Three Courts of Note, wherein the Civil, and in one  of them the Canon or Ecclesiastical Law, has been with certain  Restrictions allow'd in this Kingdom, viz. I st. The Courts  Ecclesiastical, of the Bishops and their derivative Officers.  2dly. The Admiralty Court. 3dly. The Curia Militaris, or Court of  the Constable and Marshal, or Persons commission'd to exercise  that Jurisdiction. I shall touch a little upon each of these.      First, The Ecclesiastical Courts, they are of two Kinds, viz.  1st. Such as are derived immediately by the King's Commission;  such was formerly the Court of High Commission; which tho',  without the help of an Act of Parliament, it could not in Matters  of Ecclesiastical Cognizance use any Temporal Punishment or  Censure, as Fine, Imprisoment, &c. Yet even by the Common Law,  the Kings of England, being delivered from Papal Usurpation,  might grant a Commission to hear and determine Ecclesiastical  Causes and Offences, according to the King's Ecclesiastical Laws,  as Cawdry's Case, Cook's 5th Report. 2dly. Such as are not  derived by any immediate Commission from the King; but the Laws  of England have annexed to certain Offices, Ecclesiastical  Jurisdiction, as incident to such Offices: Thus every Bishop by  his Election and Confirmation, even before Consecration, had  Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction annex'd to his Office, as Judex  Ordinarius within his Diocese; and diverse Abbots anciently, and  most Archdeacons at this Day, by Usage, have had the like  Jurisdiction within certain Limits and Precincts.      But altho' these are Judices Ordinarii, and have  Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction annex'd to their Ecclesiastical  Offices, yet this Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical in Foro Exteriori  is derived from the Crown of England: For there is no External  Jurisdiction, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, within this Realm,  but what is derived from the Crown: It is true, both anciently,  and at this Day, the process of Ecclesiastical Courts runs in the  Name, and issues under: the Seal of the Biship; and what Practice  stands so at this Day by Virtue of several Acts of Parliament,  too long here to recount. But that is no Impediment of their  deriving their Jurisdictions from the Crown; for till 27 H. 8.  cap. 24. The Process in Counties Palatine ran in the Name of the  Counts Palatine, yet no Man ever doubted, but that the Palatine  Jurisdictions were derived from the Crown.      Touching the Severance of the Bishop's Consistory from the  Sheriff's Court: See the Charter of King Will. I. and Mr.  Selden's Notes on Eadmerus.      Now the Matters of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction are of Two  Kinds, Criminal and Civil.      The Criminal Proceedings extend to such Crimes, as by the  Laws of this Kingdom are of Ecclesiastical Cognizance; as Heresy,  Fornication, Adultery, and some others, wherein their Proceedings  are, Pro Reformatione Morum, & Pro Salute Animae; and the Reason  why they have Conuzance of those and the like offences, and not  of others, as Murther, Theft, Burglary, &c. is not so much from  the Nature of the Offence (for surely the one is as much a Sin as  the other, and therefore, if their Cognizance were of Offences  quatenus peccata contra Deum, it would extend to all Sins  whatsoever, it being against God's Law). But the true Reason is,  because the Law of the Land has indulged unto that jurisdiction  the Conuzance of some Crimes and not of others.      The Civil Causes committed to their Cognizance, wherein the  Proceedings are ad lnstantiam Partis, ordinarily are Matters of  Tythes, Rights of Institution and Induction to Ecclesiastical  Benefices, Cases of Matrimony and Divorces, and Testamentary  Causes, and the Incidents thereunto, as Insinuation or Probation  of Testaments, Controversies touching the same, and of Legacies  of Goods and Moneys, &c.      Altho' de Jure Communi the Cognizance of Wills and Testaments  does not belong to the Ecclesiastical Court, but to the Temporal  or Civil jurisdiction; yet de Consuetudine Angliae Pertinet ad  Judices Ecclesiasticos, as Linwood himself agrees, Exercit. de  Testamentis, cap. 4. in Glossa. So that it is the Custom or Law  of England that gives the Extent and Limits of their external  Jurisdiction in Foro Contentioso.      The Rule by which they proceed, is the Canon Law, but not in  its full Latitude, and only so far as it stands uncorrected,  either by contrary Acts of Parliament, or the Common Law and  Custom of England; for there are divers Canons made in ancient  Times, and Decretals of the Popes that never were admitted here  in England, and particularly in relation to Tythes; many things  being by our Laws privileg'd from Tythes, which by the Canon Law  are chargeable, (as Timber, Oar, Coals, &c.) without a Special  Custom subjecting them thereunto.      Where the Canon Law, or the Stylius Curiae, is silent, the  Civil Law is taken as a Director, especially in Points of  Exposition and Determination, touching Wills and Legacies.      But Things that are of Temporal Cognizance only, cannot by  Charter be delivered over to Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, nor be  judged according to the Rules of the Canon or Civil Law, which is  aliud Examen, and not competent to the Nature of Things of Common  Law Cognizance: And therefore, Mich. 8 H. 4. Rot. 72. coram Rege.  when the Chancellor of Oxford proceeded aCcording to the Rule of  tle Civil Law in a Case of Debt, the judgment was reversed in B.  R. wherein the principal Error assigned was, because they  proceeded Per Legem Civilem iubi qiuilibet ligeus Domini Regis  Regni sui Angliae in quibusciunque Placitis & querelis infra hoc  Regnum factis & emergentibus de Jure tractar.i debt Per Communem  Legem Angliae; and altho' King H. 8. 14 Anno Regni sui, granted  to the University a liberal Charter to proceed according to the  Use of the University, viz. By a Course much conform'd to the  Civil Law; yet that Charter had not been sufficient to have  warranted such Proceedings without the Help of an Act of  Parliament: And therefore in 13 Eliz. an Act passed, whereby that  Charter was in Effect enacted; and 'tis thereby that at this Day  they have a kind of Civil Law Proceedure, even in Matters that  are of themselves of Common Law Cognizance, where either of the  Parties to the Suit are privileged.      The Coertion or Execution of the Sentence in Ecclesiastical  Courts, is only by Excommunication of the Person contumacious,  and upon Signification thereof into Chancery, a Writ de  Excommunicatio capiendo issues, whereby the Party is imprisoned  till Obedience yielded to the Sentence. But besides this  Coertion, the Sentences of the Ecclesiastical Courts touching  some Matters do introduce a real Effect, without any other  Execution; as a Divorce, a Vinculo Matrimonii for the Causes of  Consanguinity, Precontract, or Frigidity, do induce a legal  Dissolution of the Marriage; so a Sentence of Deprivation from an  Ecclesiastical Benefice, does by Virtue of the very Sentence,  without any other Coertion or Execution, introduce a full  Determination of the Interest of the Person deprived.      And thus much concerning the Ecclesiastical Courts, and the  Use of the Canon and Civil Law in them, as they are the Rule and  Direction of Proceedings therein.      Secondly, The second special Jurisdiction wherein the Civil  Law is allow'd, at least as a Director or Rule in some Cases, is  the Admiral Court or Jurisdiction. This jurisdiction is derived  also from the Crown of England, either immediately by Commission  from the King, or mediately, which is several Ways, either by  Commission from the Lord High Admiral, whose Power and  Constitution is by the King, or by the Charters granted to  particular Corporations bordering upon the Sea, and by Commission  from them, or by Prescription, which nevertheless in Presumption  of Law is derived at first from the Crown by Charter not now  extant.      The Admiral Jurisdiction is of Two Kinds, viz. Jurisdictio  Voluntaria, which is no other but the Power of the Lord High  Admiral, as the King's General at Sea over his Fleets; or  Jurisdictio Contentiosa, which is that Power of Jurisdiction  which the Judge of the Admiralty has in Foro Contentioso; and  what I have to say is of this later Jurisdiction.      The Jurisdiction of the Admiral Court, as to the Matter of  it, is confined by the Laws of this Realm to Things done upon the  High Sea only; as Depredations and Piracies upon the High Sea;  Offences of Masters and Mariners upon the High Sea; Maritime  Contracts made and to be executed upon the High Sea; Matters of  Prize and Reprizal upon the High Sea. But touching Contracts or  Things made within the Bodies of English Counties, or upon the  Land beyond the Sea, tho' the Execution thereof be in some  Measure upon the High Sea, as Charter Parties, or Contracts made  even upon the High Sea, touching Things that are not in their own  Nature Maritime, as a Bond or Contract for the Payment of Money,  so also of Damages in Navigable Rivers, within the Bodies of  Counties, Things done upon the Shore at Low-Water, Wreck of the  Sea, &c. These Things belong not to the Admiral's Jurisdiction:  And thus the Common Law, and the Statutes of I 3 Rich. 2. cap.  15. 15 Rich. 2. cap. 3. confine and limit their Jurisdiction to  Matters Maritime, and such only as are done upon the High Sea.      This Court is not bottom'd or founded upon the Authority of  the Civil Law, but hath both its Power and Jurisdiction by the  Law and Custom of the Realm, in such Matters as are proper for  its Cognizance; and this appears by their Process, viz. The  Arrest of the Persons of the Defendants, as well as by Attachment  of their Goods; and likewise by those Customs and Laws Maritime,  whereby many of their Proceedings are directed, and which are not  in many Things conformable to the Rules of the Civil Law; such  are those ancient Laws of Oleron, and other Customs introduced by  the Practice of the Sea, and Stile of the Court.      Also, The Civil Law is allowed to be the Rule of their  Proceedings, only so far as the same is not contradicted by the  Statute of this Kingdom, or by those Maritime Laws and Customs,  which in some Points have obtain'd in Derogation of the Civil  Law: But by the Statute 28 Hen. 8. cap. 15. all Treasons,  Murders, Felonies, done on the High Sea, or in any Haven, River,  Creek, Port or Place, where the Admirals have to pretend to have  Jurisdiction, are to be determined by the King's Commission, as  if the Offences were done at Land, according to the Course of the  Common Law.      And thus much shall serve touching the Court of Admiralty,  and the Use of the Civil Law therein.      Thirdly, The Third Court, wherein the Civil Law has its Use  in this Kingdom, is the Military Court, held before the Constable  and Marshal anciently, as the Judiciis Ordinarii in this Case, or  otherwise before the King's Commissioners of that Jurisdiction,  as Judices Delegati.      The Matter of their Jurisdiction is declared and limited by  the Statutes of 8 R. 2. cap. 5. and 1 3 R. 2. cap. 2. And not  only by those Statutes, but more by the very Common Law is their  Jurisdiction declared and limited as follows, viz.        First, Negatively. They are not to meddle with any Thing  determinable by the Common Law. And therefore, inasmuch as Matter  of Damages, and the Quantity and Determination thereof, is of  that Conuzance; the Court of Constable and Marshal cannot, even  in such Suits as are proper for their Conuzance, give Damages  against the Party convicted before them, and at most can only  order Reparation in Point of Honour, as Mendacium sibi ipsi  imponere: Neither can they, as to the Point of Reparation, in  Honour, hold Plea of any such Words or Things, wherein the Party  is relievable by the Courts of the Common Law.      Secondly, Affirmatively: Their Jurisdiction extends to  Matters of Arms and Matters of War, viz.        First, As to Matters of Arms (or Heraldry), the Constable and  Marshal had Conuzance thereof, viz. Touching the Rights of  Coat-Armour, Bearings, Crests, Supporters, Pennons, &c. And also  touching the Rights of Place and Precedence, in Cases where  either Acts of Parliament or the King's Patent (he being the  Fountain of Honour) have not already determined it, for in such  Cases they have no Power to alter it. Those Things were anciently  allowed to the Conuzance of the Constable and Marshal, as having  some Relation to Military Affairs; but so restrain'd, that they  were only to determine the Right, and give Reparation to the  Party injured in Point of Honour, but not to repair him in  Damages.      But, Secondly, As to Matters of War. The Constable and  Marshal had a double Power, viz.      1. A Ministerial Power, as they were Two great ordinary  Officers, anciently, in the King's Army; the Constable being in  Effect the King's General, and the Marshal was employed in  marshalling the King's Army, and keeping the List of the Officers  and Soldiers therein; and his Certificate was the Trial of those  whose Attendance was requisite. Vide Littleton, ? 102.      Again, 2. The Constable and Marshal had also a Judicial  Power, or a Court wherein several Matters were determinable: As  1st, Appeals of Death or Murder committed beyond the Sea,  according to the Course of the Civil Law. 2dly, The Rights of  Prisoners taken in War. 3dly, The Offences and Miscarriages of  Soldiers contrary to the Laws and Rules of the Army: For always  preparatory to an actual War, the Kings of this Realm, by Advice  of the Constable, (and Marshal) were used to compose a Book of  Rules and Orders for the due Order and Discipline of their  Officers and Soldiers, together with certain Penalties on the  Offenders; and this was called, Martial Law. We have extant in  the Black Book of the Admiralty, and elsewhere, several Exemplars  of such Military Laws, and especially that of the 9th of Rich. 2.  composed by the King, with the Advice of the Duke of Lancaster,  and others.      But touching the Business of Martial Law, these Things are to  be observed, viz.        First, That in Truth and Reality it is not a Law, but  something indulged rather than allowed as a Law; the Necessity of  Government, Order and Discipline in an Army, is that only which  can give those Laws a Countenance, Quod enim Necessitas cogit  desendi.      Secondly, This indulged Law was only to extend to Members of  the Army, or to those of the opposite Army, and never was so wuch  indulged as intended to be (executed or) exercised upon others;  for others who were not listed under the Army, had no Colour of  Reason to be bound by Military Constitutions, applicable only to  the Army, whereof they were not Parts; but they were to be  order'd and govern' d according to the Laws to which they were  subject, though it were a Time of War.      Thirdly, That the Exercise of Martial Law, whereby any Person  should lose his Life or Member, or Liberty, may not be permitted  in Time of Peace, when the King's Courts are open for all Persons  to receive Justice, according to the Laws of the Land. This is in  Substance declared by the Petition of Right, 3 Car. I. whereby  such Commissions and Martial Law were repealed, and declared to  be contrary to Law: And accordingly was that famous Case of  Edmond Earl of Kent; who being taken at Pomsret, 15 Ed. 2. the  King and divers Lords proceeded to give Sentence of Death against  him, as in a kind of Military Court by a Summary Proceeding;  which Judgment was afterwards in 1 Ed. 3. revers'd in Parliament:  And the Reason of that Reversal serving to the Purpose in Hand, I  shall here insert it as entered in the Record, viz.        Quod cum quicunq; homo ligeus Domini Regis pro Seditionibus,  &c. tempore pacis captus & in quacunque Curia Domini Regis ductus  fuerit de ejusmodi Seditionibus & aliis Felonius sibi impositis  per Legem & Consuetudine Regni arrectari debet & Responsionem  adduci, Et inde per Communem Legem, antequam fuerit Morti  adiudicand' (triari) &c. Unde cum notorium sit & manifestum quod  totum tempus quo impositum fuit eidem Comiti propter Mala &  Facionora fecisse, ad tempus in quo captus fuit & in quo Morti  adiudicatus fuit, fuit tempus Pacis maximae, Cum per totum tempus  praedictum & Cancellaria & aliae plac. Curiae Domini Regis aperte  fuer' in quibus cuilibet Lex Sebatur sicut Seri consuevit, Nec  idem Dominus Rex unquam tempore illo cum vexillis explicatis  Equitabat, &c.        And accordingly the Judgment was revers'd; for Martial Law,  which is rather indulg'd than allow'd, and that only in Cases of  Necessity, in Time of open War, is not permitted in Time of  Peace, when the ordinary Courts of Justice are open.      In this Military Court, Court of Honour, or Court Martial,  the Civil Law has been used and allowed in such Things as belong  to their Jurisdiction; as the Rule or Direction of their  Proceedings and Decisions, so far forth as the same is not  controuled by the Laws of this Kingdom, and those Customs and  Usages which have obtain'd in England, which even in Matters of  Honour are in some Points derogatory to the Civil Law. But this  Court has been long disused upon great Reasons.      And thus I have given a brief Prospect of these Courts and  Matters, wherein the Canon and Civil Law has been in some Measure  allowed, as the Rule or Direction of Proceedings or Decisions:  But although in these Courts and Matters the Laws of England,  upon the Reasons and Account before expressed, have admitted the  Use and Rule of the Canon and Civil Law; yet even herein also,  the Common Law of England has retain'd those Signa  Superioritatis, and the Preference and Superintendence in  relation to those Courts: Namely,        1st. As the Laws and Statutes of the Realm have prescribed to  those Courts their Bounds and Limits, so the Courts of Common Law  have the Superintendency over those Courts, to keep them within  the Limits and Bounds of their several Jurisdictions, and to  judge and determine whether they have exceeded those Bounds, or  not; and in Case they do exceed their Bounds, the Courts at  Common Law issue their Prohibitions to restrain them, directed  either to the Judge or Party, or both: And also, in case they  exceed their Jurisdiction, the Officer that executes the  Sentence, and in some Cases the Judge that gives it, are  punishable in the Courts at Common Law; sometimes at the Suit of  the King, sometimes at the Suit of the Party, and sometimes at  the Suit of both, according to the Variety and Circumstances of  the Case.      2dly. The Common Law, and the Judges of the Courts of Common  Law, have the Exposition of such Statutes or Acts of Parliament  as concern either the Extent of the Jurisdiction of those Courts  (whether Ecclesiastical, Maritime or Military) or the Matters  depending before them; and therefore, if those Courts either  refuse to allow these Acts of Parliament, or expound them in any  other Sense than is truly and properly the Exposition of them,  the King's Great Courts of the Common Law (who next under the  King and his Parliament have the Exposition of those Laws) may  prohibit and controul them.      And thus much touching those Courts wherein the Civil and  Canon Laws are allowed as Rules and Directions under the  Restrictions above-mentioned: Touching which, the Sum of the  Whole is this:        First, That the Jurisdiction exercised in those Courts is  derived from the Crown of England, and that the last Devolution  is to the King, by Way of Appeal.      Secondly, That although the Canon or Civil Law be  respectively allowed as the Direction or Rule of their  Proceedings, yet that is not as if either of those Laws had any  original Obligation in England, either as they are the Laws of  Emperors, Popes, or General Councils, but only by Virtue of their  Admission here, which is evident; for that those Canons or  Imperial Constitutions which have not been receiv'd here do not  bind; and also, for that by several contrary Customs and Stiles  used here many of those Civil and Canon Laws are controuled and  derogated.      Thirdly, That although those Laws are admitted in some Cases  in those Courts, yet they are but Leges sub graviori Lege; and  the Common Laws of this Kingdom have ever obtain'd and retain'd  the Superintendency over them, and those Signa Superioritatis  before-mentioned, for the Honour of the King and the Common Laws  of England.      III. Concerning the Common Law of England, its Use and  Excellence, and the Reason of its Denomination        I Come now to that other Branch of our Laws, the Common  Municipal Law of this Kingdom, which has the Superintendency of  all those other particular Laws used in the before-mentioned  Courts, and is the common Rule for the Administration of common  Justice in this great Kingdom; of which it has been always  tender, and there is great Reason for it; for it is not only a  very just and excellent Law in it self, but it is singularly  accommodated to the Frame of the English Government, and to the  Disposition of the English Nation, and such as by a long  Experience and Use is as it were incorporated into their very  Temperament, and, in a Manner, become the Complection and  Constitution of the English Commonwealth.      Insomuch, that even as in the natural Body the due  Temperament and Constitution does by Degrees work out those  accidental Diseases which sometimes happen, and do reduce the  Body to its just State and Constitution; so when at any Time  through the Errors, Distempers or Iniquities of Men or Times, the  Peace of the Kingdom, and right Order of Government, have  received Interruption, the Common Law has wasted and wrought out  those Distempers, and reduced the Kingdom to its just State and  Temperament, as our present (and former) Times can easily  witness.      This Law is that which asserts, maintains, and, with all  imaginable Care, provides for the Safety of the King's Royal  Person, his Crown and Dignity, and all his just Rights, Revenues,  Powers, Prerogatives and Government, as the great Foundation  (under God) of the Peace, Happiness, Honour and Justice, of this  Kingdom; and this Law is also, that which declares and asserts  the Rights and Liberties, and the Properties of the Subject; and  is the just, known, and common Rule of Justice and Right between  Man and Man, within this Kingdom.      And from hence it is, that the Wisdom of the Kings of  England, and their great Council, the Honourable House of  Parliament, have always been jealous and vigilant for the  Reformation of what has been at any Time found defective in it,  and so to remove all such Obstacles as might obstruct the free  Course of it, and to support, countenance and encourage the Use  of it, as the best, safest and truest Rule of Justice in all  Matters, as well Criminal as Civil.      I should be too Voluminous to give those several Instances  that occur frequently in the Statutes, the Parliament Rolls, and  Parliamentary Petitions, touching this Matter; and shall  therefore only instance in some few Particulars in both Kinds,  viz. Criminal and Civil: And First, in Matters Civil.      In the Parliament 18 Edw. 1. In a Petition in the Lords  House, touching Land between Hugh Lowther and Adam Edingthorp:  The Defendant alledges, That if the Title should in this Manner  be proceeded in, he should lose the Benefit of his Warranty; and  also, that the Plaintiff, if he hath any Right, hath his Remedy  at Common Law by Assize of Mortdancestor, and therefore demands  Judgment, Si de libero Tenemento debeat hic sine brevi  Respondere; and the Judgment of the Lords in Parliament thereupon  is enter'd in these Words, viz.        Et quia actio de predicto Tenemento petendo & etiam suum  recuperare, si quid habere debeat vel possit eidem Adae per  Assisam mortis Antecessoris competere debet nec est juri consonum  vel hactenus in Curia ista usitat' quod aliquis sine Lege  Communi, & Brevi de Cancellaria de libero Tenemento suo  respondeat & maxime in Casu ubi Breve de Cancellaria Locum habere  potest, dictum est praefato Adae quod sibi perquirat per Breve de  Cancellaria, si sibi viderit Expederire.        Rot. Parl. 13 R. 2. No. 10. Adam Chaucer preferr'd his  Petition to the King and Lords in Parliament, against Sir Robert  Knolles, to be relieved touching a Mortgage, which he supported  was satisfied, and to have Restitution of his Lands. The  Defendant appeared, and upon the several Allegations on both  Sides, the Judgment is thus entered, viz.        Et apres les Raisons & les Allegeances de l'un party & de  l'autre, y sembles a Seigneurs du Parlement que le dit Petition  ne estoit Petition du Parlement, deins que le mattier en icel  comprize dovii estre discuss per le Commune Ley. St pur ceo agard  suit que le dit Robert iroit eut sans jour & que le dit Adam ne  prendroit rien per say suit icy, eins que il sueroit per le  Commune Ley si il luy sembloit ceo faire.        Where we may note, the Words are Dovit estre, and not Poet  estre discusse Per le, &c.        Rot. Parl. 5o Ed. 3. No. 43. A Judgment being given against  the Bishop of Norwich, for the Archdeaconry of Norwich, in the  Common Bench, the Bishop petitioned the Lords in Parliament, that  the Record might be brought into that House, and to be reversed  for Error.        Et quoy a luy estoit finalement Respondu per common Assent  des ils les Justices que si Error y fust si ascun a fine force  per le Ley de Angleterre tiel Error fuit voire en Parlement  immediatement per voy de Error ains en Bank le Roy, & en nul part  ailhors, Mais si le Case avenoit que Error fust fait en Bank le  Roy adonque ceo serra amendes en Parlement.        And let any Man but look over the Rolls of Parliament, and  the Bundles of Petitions in Parliament, of the Times of Ed. I.  Ed. 2. Ed. 3. Hen. 4. H. 5. & H. 6. he will find Hundreds of  Answers of Petitions in Parliament concerning Matters  determinable at Common Law, endorsed with Answers to this, or the  like Effect, viz "Suez vous a le Commune Ley; sequatur ad  Communem Legem; Perquirat Breve in Cancellaria si sibi viderit  expedire; ne est Petition du Parlement, Mandetur ista Petitio in  Cancellarium, vel Cancellario, vel justiciariis de Banco, vel  Thesaurario & Baronibus de Scaccario," and the like.      And these were not barely upon the Bene Placita of the Lords,  but were De jure, as appears by those former Judgments given in  the Lords House in Parliament; and the Reason is evident; First,  Because, if such a Course of extraordinary Proceeding should be  had before the Lords in the first Instance, the Party should lose  the Benefit of his Appeal by Writ of Error, according as the Law  allows; and that is the Reason, why even in a Writ of Error, or  Petition of Error upon a Judgment in any inferior Court, it  cannot go Per Saltum into Parliament, till it has passed the  Court of King's-Bench; for that the first appeal is thither.  Secondly, Because the Subject would by that Means lose his Trial  Per Pares, and consequently his Attaint, in case of a Mistake in  Point of Issue or Damages: To both which he is entitled by Law.      And although some Petitions of this Nature have been  deterwined in that Manner, yet it has been (generally) when the  Exception has not been started, or at least not insisted upon:  And One Judgment in Parliament, that Cases of that Nature ought  to be determined according to the Course of the Common Law, is of  greater Weight than many Cases to the contrary, wherein the  Question was not stirred: Yea, even tho' it should be stirred,  and the contrary affirm'd upon a Debate of the Question, because  greater Weight is to be laid upon the Judgment of any Court when  it is exclusive of its jurisdiction, than upon a judgment of the  same Court in Affirmance of it.      Now as to Matters Criminal, whether Capital or not, they are  determinable by the Common Law, and not otherwise; and in  Affirmance of that Law, where the Statutes of Magna Charta, cap.  29. 5 Ed. 3. cap. 9. 25 Ed. 3. cap. 4. 29 Ed. 3. cap. 3. 27 Ed.  3. cap. 17. 38 Ed. 3. cap. 9. & 4o Ed. 3. cap. 3. The Effect of  which is, That no Man shall be put out of his Lands or Tenewents,  or be imprisoned by any Suggestion, unless it be by Indictment or  Presentment of lawful Men, or by Process at Comwon Law.      And by the Statute of 1 Hen. 4. cap. 14. it is enacted, That  no Appeals be sued in Parliament at any Time to come: This  extends to all Accusations by particular Persons, and that not  only of Treason or Felony, but of other Crimes and Misdemeanors.  It is true, the Petition upon which that Act was drawn up, begins  with Appeals of Felony and Treason, but the Close thereof, as  also the King's Answer, refers as well to Misdemeanors as matters  Capital; and because this Record will give a great Light to this  whole Business, I will here set down the Petition and the Answer  verbatim. Vide Rot. Parl. I Hen. 4. No. 144.        Item, Supplyont les Commens que desore en avant nul appele de  Traison ne de autre Felony quelconq; soit accept ou receive en le  Parlement ains en vous autres Courts de dans vostre Realm  dementiers que en vous dits Courts purra estre Terminer come ad  ote fait & use ancienement en temps de vous noble Progeniteurs;  Et que chescun Person qui en temps a venir serra accuse ou  impeach en vostre Parlement ou en ascuns des vos dits Courts per  les Seigniors & Commens di vostre Realm ou per ascun Person &  defence ou Response a son Accusement ou Empeachment & sur son  Response reasonable Record Judgment & Tryal come de ancienement  temps ad estre fait & use per les bones Leges de vostre Realm,  nient obstant que les dits Empeachments ou Accusements soient  faits per les Seigneurs ou Commens de vostre Relme come que de  novel en temps de Ric. nadgarius Roy ad estre fait & use a  contrar, a tres grand Mischief & tres grand Maleveys Exemple de  vostre Realm.        Le Roy voet que de cy en avant touts les Appeles de choses  faits deins le Relme soient tryez & terwinez per les bones Leys  faits en temps de tres noble Progeniteurs de nostre dit Seigneur  le Roy, Et que touts les Appeles de choses faits hors du Realm,  soient triez & terminez devant le Constable & Marshal de  Angleterre, & que nul Appele soit fait en Parlement desore en  ascun tempts a venir.        This is the Petition and Answer. The Statute as drawn up  hereupon, is general, and runs thus:        Item. Pur plusieurs grands Inconveniencies & Mischeifs que  plusieurs fait ont advenus per colour des plusieurs Appeles faits  deins le Realm avant ces heurs ordain est & establuz, Que desore  en avant touts Appeles de choses faits deins le Realm soient  tries & termines per les bones Leys de le Realm faits & uses en  temps de tres noble Progeniteurs de dit nostre Seigneur le Roy;  Etque ils les Appeles de choses faits hors du Realm soient tries  & termines devant le Constable & Marshal pur les temps esteant;  Et ouster accordes est & assentus que nulls Appeles soient desore  faits ou pursues en Parlement en nul temps avenir.        Where we may observe, That thougb the Petition expresses  (only) Treason and Felony, yet the Act is general against all  Appeals in Parliament; and many Times the Purview of an Act is  larger than the Preamble, or the Petition, and so 'tis here: For  the Body of the Act prohibits all Appeals in Parliament, and  there was Reason for it: For the Mischief, viz. Appeals in  Parliament in the Time of King Richard 2 (as in the Petition is  set forth) were not only of Treason and Felony, but of  Misdemeanors also, as appears by that great Proceeding, 11 R. 2,  against divers, by the Lords Appellants, and consequently it was  necessary to have the Remedy as large as the Mischief. And I do  not remember that after this Statute there were any Appeals in  Parliament, either for Matters Capital or Criminal, at the Suit  of any Particular Person or Persons.      It is true, Impeachments by the House of Commons, sent up to  the House of Lords, were frequent as well after as before this  Statute, and that justly, and with good Reason; for that neither  the Act nor the Petition ever intended to restrain them, but only  to regulate them, viz. That the Parties might be admitted to  their Defence to them, and as neither the Words of the Act nor  the Practice of After-times extended to restrain such  Impeachments as were made by the House of Commons, so neither do  those Impeachments and Appeals agree in their Nature or Reason;  for Appeals were nothing else but Accusations, either of Capital  or Criminal Misdemeanors, made in the Lords House by particular  Persons; but an Impeachment is made by the Body of the House of  Commons, which is equivalent to an Indictment Pro Corpore Regni,  and therefore is of another Nature than an Accusation or Appeal,  only herein they agree, viz. Impeachments in Cases Capital  against Peers of the Realm, have been ever tried and determined  in the Lords House; but Impeachments against a Commoner have not  been usual in the House of Lords, unless preparatory to a Bill,  or to direct an Indictment in the Courts below: But Impeachments  at the Prosecutions of the House of Commons, for Misdemeanors as  well against a Commoner as any other, have usually received their  Determinations and final Judgments in the House of Lords; whereof  there have been numerous Precedents in all Times, both before and  since the said Act.      And thus much in general touching the great Regard that  Parliaments and the Kingdom have had, and that most justly, to  the Common Law, and the great Care they have had to preserve and  maintain it, as the Common Interest and Birthright of the King  and Kingdom.      I shall now add some few Words touching the Stiles and  Appellations of the Common Law, and the Reasons of it: 'Tis  called sometimes by Way of Eminence, Lex Terrae, as in the  Statute of Magna Charta, cap. 29. where certainly the Common Law  is at least principally intended by those Words, aut Per Legem  Terrae, as appears by the Exposition thereof in several  subsequent Statutes, and particularly in the Statute 28 Ed. 3.  cap. 3 which is but an Exposition and Declaration of that  Statute: Sometimes 'tis called, Lex Angliae, as in the Statute of  Merton, cap.... Nolumus Leges Angliae mutare, &c. Sometimes 'tis  called, Lex & Consuetudo Regni, as in all Commissions of Oyer and  Terminer, and in the Statutes of 18 Ed. I. cap.... and De quo  Warranto, and divers others; but most commonly 'tis called, The  Common Law, or, The Common Law of England, as in the Statute of  Articuli super Chartas, cap. 15. in the Statute 25 Ed. 3. cap. 5.  and infinite more Records and Statutes.      Now the Reason why 'tis call'd The Common Law, or what was  the Occasion that first gave that Determination to it, is  variously assigned, viz.      First, Some have thought it to be so called by Way of  Contradistinction to those other Laws that have obtain'd within  this Kingdom; as, 1st. By Way of Contradistinction to the Statute  Law, thus a Writ of Entry ad Communem Legem, is so call'd in  Contradistinction to Writs of Entry in Casu consimili, and Casu  Proviso, which are given by Act of Parliament. 2dly, By Way of  Contradistinction to particular Customary Laws: Thus Discents at  Common Law, Dower at Common Law, are in Contradistinction to such  Dowers and Discents as are directed by particular Customs. And  3dly, In Contradistinction to the Civil, Canon, Martial and  Military Laws, which are in some particular Cases and Courts  admitted, as the Rule of their Proceedings.      Secondly, Some have conceived, that the Reason of this  Appellation was this, viz. In the Beginning of the Reign of  Edward 3 before the Conquest, commonly called, Edward the  Confessor, there were several Laws, and of several Natures, which  obtain'd in several Parts of this Kingdom, viz. The Mercian Laws,  in the counties of Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, Warwick,  Oxon, Chester, Salop and Stafford. The Danish Laws, in the  Counties of York, Derby, Nottingham, Leicester, Lincoln,  Northampton, Bedford, Bucks, Hertford, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk,  Suffolk, Cambridge and Huntington. The West-Saxon Laws, in the  Counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Berks, Southampton, Wilts,  Somerset, Dorset, and Devon.      This King, to reduce the Kingdom as well under one Law, as it  then was under one Monarchical Government, extracted out of all  those Provincial Laws, one Law to be observed through the whole  Kingdom: Thus Ranulphus Cestrensis, cited by Sir Henry Spelman in  his Glossary, under the Title Lex, says, "Ex tribus his Legibus  Sanctus Edvardus unam Legem ----" &c. And the same in totidem  verbis, is affirmed in his History of the last Year of the same  King Edward. (Vide ibid. Plura de hoc) But Hoveden carries up the  Common Laws, or those stiled the Confessor's Laws, much further;  for he in his History of Henry 2 tell us, "Quod istae Leges prius  inventae & constitutae erant Tempore Edgari, Avi sui," &c. (Vide  Hoveden) And possibly the Grandfather might be the first  Collector of them into a Body, and afterwards Edward might add to  the Composition, and give it the Denomination of the Common Law.  but the Original of it cannot in Truth be referred to either, but  is much more ancient, and is as undiscoverable as the Head of  Nile: Of which more at large in the following Chapter.      Thirdly, Others say, and that most truly, That it is called  the Common Law, because it is the common Municipal Law or Rule of  justice in this Kingdom: So that Lex Communis, or Jus Communis,  is all one and the same with Lex Patriae, or Jus Patrium; for  although there are divers particular Laws, some by Custom applied  to particular Places, and some to particular Causes; yet that Law  which is common to the generality of all Persons, Things and  Causes, and has a Superintendency over those particular Laws that  are admitted in Relation to particular Places or Matters, is Lex  Communis Angliae, as the Municipal Laws of other Countries may  be, and are sometimes called, The Common Law of that Country,. as  Lex Communis Norrica, Lex Communis Burgundica, Lex Communis  Lombardica, &c. So that although all the former Reasons have  their Share in this Appellation, yet the principal Cause thereof  seems to be the latter: And hence some of the Ancients call'd it  Lex Communis. others Lex Patriae; and so they were called in  their Confirmation by King William I. Whereof hereafter.      IV. Touching the Original of the Common Law of England        The Kingdom of England being a very ancient Kingdom, has had  many Vicissitudes and Changes (especially before the coming in of  King William I) under several either Conquests or Accessions of  Foreign Nations. For tho' the Britains were, as is supposed, the  most ancient Inhabitants, yet there were mingled with them, or  brought in upon them, the Romans, the Picts, the Saxons, the  Danes, and lastly, the Normans; and many of those Foreigners were  as it were incorporated together, and made one Common People and  Nation; and hence arises the Difficulty, and indeed Moral  Impossibility, of giving any satisfactory or so much as probable  Conjecture, touching the Original of the Laws, for the following  Reasons, viz.      First, From the Nature of Laws themselves in general, which  being to be accommodated to the Conditions, Exigencies and  Conveniencies of the People, for or by whom they are appointed,  as those Exigencies and Conveniencies do insensibly grow upon the  People, so many Times there grows insensibly a Variation of Laws,  especially in a long Tract of Time; and hence it is, that tho'  for the Purpose in some particular Part of the Common Law of  England, we may easily say, That the Common Law, as it is now  taken, is otherwise than it was in that particular Part or Point  in the Time of Hen. 2 when Glanville wrote, or than it was in the  time of Hen. 3 when Bracton wrote, yet it is not possible to  assign the certain Time when the Change began; nor have we all  the Monuments or Memorials, either of Acts of Parliament, or of  Judicial Resolutions, which might induce or occasion such  Alterations; for we have no authentick Records of any Acts of  Parliament before 9 Hen. 3 and those we have of that King's Time,  are but few. Nor have we any Reports of Judicial Decisions in any  constant Series of Time before the Reign of Edw. I tho' we have  the Plea Rolls of the Times of Hen. 3 and King John, in some  remarkable Order. So that Use and Custom, and Judicial Decisions  and Resolutions, and Acts of Parliament, tho' not now extant,  might introduce some New Laws, and alter some Old, which we now  take to be the very Common Law itself, tho' the Times and precise  Periods of such Alterations are not explicitely or clearly known:  But tho' those particular Variations and Accessions have happened  in the Laws, yet they being only partial and successive, we may  with just Reason say, They are the same English Laws now, that  they were 600 Years since in the general. As the Argonauts Ship  was the same when it returned home, as it was when it went out,  tho' in that long Voyage it had successive Amendments, and scarce  came back with any of its former Materials; and as Titius is the  same Man he was 40 Years since, tho' Physicians tells us, That in  a Tract of seven Years, the Body has scarce any of the same  Material Substance it had before.      Secondly, The 2d Difficulty in the Search of the Antiquity of  Laws and their Original, is in Relation to that People unto whom  the Laws are applied, which in the Case of England, will render  many Observables, to shew it hard to be traced. For,      1st, It is an ancient Kingdom, and in such Cases, tho' the  People and Government had continued the same ab Origine (as they  say the Chinese did, till the late Incursion of the Tartars)  without the Mixture of other People, or Laws; yet it were an  impossible Thing to give any certain Account of the Original of  the Laws of such a People, unless we had as certain Monuments  thereof as the Jews had of theirs, by the Hand of Moses, and that  upon the following Accounts, viz.      First, We have not any clear and certain Monuments of the  original Foundation of the English Kingdom or State, when, and by  whom, and how it came to be planted. That which we have  concerning it, is uncertain and traditional; and since we cannot  know the Original of the planting of this Kingdom, we cannot  certainly know the Original of the Laws thereof, which may be  well presum'd to be very near as ancient as the Kingdom itself.  Again, 2dly, Tho' Tradition might be a competent Discoverer of  the Original of a Kingdom or State, I mean Oral Tradition, yet  such a Tradition were incompetent without written Monuments to  derive to us, at so long a Distance, the original Laws and  Constitutions of the Kingdom, because they are of a complex  Nature, and therefore not orally traducible to so great a  Distance of Ages, unless we had the original or authentick  Transcript of those Laws as the People the Jews had of their Law,  or as the Romans had of their Laws of the Twelve Tables engraven  in Brass. But yet further, 3dly, It is very evident to every  Day's Experience, that Laws, the further they go from their  original Institution, grow the larger, and the more numerous: In  the first Coalition of a People, their Prospect is not great,  they provide Laws for their present Exigence and Convenience: But  in Process of Time, possibly their first Laws are changed,  altered or antiquated, as some of the Laws of the Twelve Tables  among the Romans were: But whatsoever be done touching their Old  Laws, there must of Necessity be a Provision of New, and other  Laws successively answering to the Multitude of successive  Exigencies and Emergencies, that in a long Tract of Time will  offer themselves; so that if a Man could at this Day have the  Prospects of all the Laws of the Britains before any Invasion  upon them, it would yet be impossible to say, which of them were  New, and which were Old, and the several Seasons and Periods of  Time wherein every Law took its Rise and Original, especially  since it appears, that in those elder Times, the Britains were  not reduced to that civiliz'd Estate, as to keep the Annals and  Memorials of their Laws and Government, as the Romans and other  civiliz'd Parts of the World have done.      It is true, when the Conquest of a Country appears, we can  tell when the Laws of conquering People came to be given to the  Conquered. Thus we can tell that in the Time of Hen. 2 when the  Conquest of Ireland had obtain'd a good Progress, and in the Time  of K. John, when it was compleated, the English Laws were settled  in Ireland: But if we were upon this Inquiry, What were the  Original of those English Laws that were thus settled there; we  are still under the same Quest and Difficulty that we are now,  viz. What is the Original of the English Laws. For they that  begin New Colonies, Plantations and Conquests; if they settle New  Laws, and which the Places had not before, yet for the most Part  (I don't say altogether) they are the Old Laws which obtain'd in  those Countries from whence the Conquerors or Planters came.      Secondly, the 2d Difficulty of the Discovery of the Original  of the English Laws is this, That this Kingdom has had many and  great Vicissitudes of People that inhabited it, and that in their  several Times prevail'd and obtain'd a great Hand in the  Government of this Kingdom, whereby it came to pass, that there  arose a great Mixture and Variety of Laws: In some Places the  Laws of the Saxons, in some Places the Laws of the Danes, in some  Places the Laws of the ancient Britains, in some Places, the Laws  of the Mercians, and in some Places, or among some People  (perhaps) the Laws of the Normans: For altho', as I shall shew  hereafter, the Normans never obtain'd this Kingdom by such a  Right of Conquest, as did or might alter the established Laws of  the Kingdom; yet considering that K. Will. I brought with him a  great Multitude of that Nation, and many Persons of great Power  and Eminence, which were planted generally over this Kingdom,  especially in the Possessions of such as had oppos'd his coming  in, it must needs be suppos'd, that those Occurrences might  easily have a great Influence upon the Laws of this Kingdom, and  secretly and insensibly introduce New Laws, Customs and Usages;  so that altho' the Body and Gross of the Law might continue the  same, and so continue the ancient Denomination that it first had,  yet it must needs receive diverse Accessions from the Laws of  those People that were thus intermingled with the ancient  Britains or Saxons, as the Rivers of Severn, Thames, Trent, &c.  tho' they continue the same Denomination which their first Stream  had, yet have the Accession of divers other Streams added to them  in the Tracts of their Passage which enlarge and augment them.  And hence grew those several Denominations of the Saxon,  Merician, and Danish Laws, out of which (as before is shewn) the  Confessor extracted his Body of the Common Law, and therefore  among all those various Ingredients and Mixtures of Laws, it is  almost an impossible Piece of Chymistry to reduce every Caput  Legis to its true Original, as to say, This is a Piece of the  Danish, this of the Norman, or this of the Saxon or British Law:  Neither was it, or indeed is it much material, which of these is  their Original; for 'tis very plain, the Strength and Obligation,  and the formal Nature of a Law, is not upon Account that the  Danes, or the Saxons, or the Normans, brought it in with them,  but they became Laws, and binding in this Kingdom, by Virtue only  of their being received and approved here.      Thirdly, A Third Difficulty arises from those accidental  Emergencies that happened, either in the Alteration of Laws, or  communicating or conveying of them to this Kingdom: For first,  the Subdivision of the Kingdom into small Kingdoms under the  Heptarchy, did most necessarily introduce a Variation of Laws,  because the several Parts of the Kingdom, were not under one  common Standard, and so it will soon be in any Kingdoms that are  cantonized, and not under one common Method of Dispensation of  Laws, tho' under one and the same King. Again, The Intercourse  and Traffick with other Nations, as it grew more or greater, did  gradually make a Communication and Transmigration of Laws from us  to them, and from them to us. Again, The Growth of Christianity  in this Kingdom, and the Reception of Learned Men from other  Parts, especially from Rome, and the Credit that they obtained  here, might reasonably introduce some New Laws, and antiquate or  abrogate some Old ones that seem'd less consistent with the  Christian Doctrines, and by this Means, not only some of the  Judicial Laws of the Jews, but also some Points relating to, or  bordering upon, or derived from the Canon or Civil Laws, as may  be seen in those Laws of the ancient Kings, Ina, Alphred,  Canutus, &c. collected by Mr. Lambard.      Having thus far premised, it seems, upon the whole Matter, an  endless and insuperable Business to carry up the English Laws to  their several Springs and Heads, and to find out their first  Original; neither would it be of any Moment or Use if it were  done: For whenever the Laws of England, or the several Capita  thereof began, or from whence or whomsoever derived, or what Laws  of other Countries contributed to the Matter of our Laws; yet  most certainly their Obligation arises not from their Matter, but  from their Admission and Reception, and Authorization in this  Kingdom; and those Laws, if convenient and useful for the  Kingdom, were never the worse, tho' they were desumed and taken  from the Laws of other Countries, so as they had their Stamp of  Obligation and Authority from the Reception and Approbation of  this Kingdom by Virtue of the Common Law, of which this Kingdom  has been always jealous, especially in relation to the Canon,  Civil, and Norman Law, for the Reasons hereafter shewn.      Passing therefore from this unsearchable Inquiry, I shall  descend to that which gives the Authority, viz. The formal  Constituents, as I may call them, of the Common Law, and they  seem to be principally, if not only, those three, viz. 1st. The  Common Usage, or Custom, and Practice of this Kingdom, in such  Parts thereof as lie in Usage or Custom. 2dly. The Authority of  Parliament, introducing such Laws; and, 3dly. The Judicial  Decisions of Courts of Justice, consonant to one another in the  Series and Successions of Time.      1. As to the first of these, Usage and Custom generally  receiv'd, do Obtinere vim Legis, and is that which gives Power  sometimes to the Canon Law, as in the Ecclesiastical Courts;  sometimes to the Civil Law, as in the Admiralty Courts; and  again, controuls both, when they cross other Customs that are  generally receiv'd in the Kingdom. This is that which directs  Discents, has settled some ancient Ceremonies and Solemnities in  Conveyances, Wills and Deeds, and in many more Particulars. And  if it be enquired, What is the Evidence of this Custom, or  wherein it consists, or is to be found? I answer, It is not  simply an unwritten Custom, not barely Orally deriv'd down from  one Age to another; but it is a Custom that is derived down in  Writing, and transmitted from Age to Age, especially since the  Beginning of Edw. I to whose Wisdom the Laws of England owe  almost as much as the Laws of Rome to Justinian.      2. Acts of Parliament. And here it must not be wonder'd at,  that I make Acts of Parliament one of the Authoritative  Constituents of the Common Law, tho' I had before  contradistinguished the one from the other; for we are to know,  that although the Original or Authentick Transcripts of Acts of  Parliament are not before the Time of Hen. 3 and many that were  in his Time are perish'd and lost; yet certainly such there were,  and many of those Things that we now take for Common Law, were  undoubtedly Acts of Parliament, tho' now not to be found of  Record. And if in the next Age, the Statutes made in the Time of  Hen. 3 and Edw. I were lost, yet even those would pass for Parts  of the Common Law, and indeed, by long Usage and the many  Resolutions grounded upon them, and by their great Antiquity,  they seem even already to be incorporated with the very Common  Law; and that this is so, may appear, tho' not by Records, for we  have none so ancient, yet by an authentical and unquestionable  History, wherein a Man may, without Much Difficulty, find, That  many of those Capitala Legum that are now used and taken for  Common Law, were things enacted in Parliaments or Great Councils  under William I and his Predecessors, Kings of England, as may be  made appear hereafter. But yet, those Constitutions and Laws  being made before Time of Memory, do now obtain, and are taken as  Part of the Common Law and immemorial Customs of the Kingdom; and  so they ought now to be esteem'd tho' in their first Original  they were Acts of Parliament.      3. Judicial Decisions. It is true, the Decisions of Courts of  Justice, tho' by Virtue of the Laws of this Realm they do bind,  as a Law between the Parties thereto, as to the particular Case  in Question, 'till revers'd by Error or Attaint, yet they do not  make a Law properly so called, (for that only the King and  Parliament can do); yet they have a great Weight and Authority in  Expounding, Declaring, and Publishing what the Law of this  Kingdom is, especially when such Decisions hold a Consonancy and  Congruity with Resolutions and Decisions of former Times; and  tho' such Decisions are less than a Law, yet they are a greater  Evidence thereof than the Opinion of any private Persons, as  such, whatsoever.      1st. Because the Persons who pronounce those Decisions, are  Men chosen by the King for that Employment, as being of greater  Learning, Knowledge, and Experience in the Laws than others.  2dly. Because they are upon their Oaths to judge according to the  Laws of the Kingdom. 3dly. Because they have the best Helps to  inform their Judgments. 4thly. Because they do Sedere Pro  Tribunali, and their Judgments are strengthen'd and upheld by the  Laws of this Kingdom, till they are by the same Law revers'd or  avoided.        Now Judicial Decisions, as far as they refer to the Laws of  this Kingdom, are for the Matter of them of Three Kinds:      First, They are either such as have their reasons singly in  the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom, as, Who shall succeed as  Heir to the Ancestor, what is the Ceremony requisite for passing  a Freehold, what Estate, and how much shall the Wife have for her  Dower? And many such Matters wherein the ancient and express Laws  of the Kingdom give an express Decision, and the Judge seems only  the instrument to pronounce it; and in these Things, the Law or  custom of the Realm is the only Rule and Measure to judge by, and  in reference to those Matters, the Decisions of Courts are the  Conservatories and Evidences of those Laws.      Secondly, Or they are such Decisions, as by Way of Deduction  and Illation upon those Laws are framed or deduced; as for the  Purpose, Whether of an Estate thus or thus limited, the Wife  shall be endowed? Whether if thus or thus limited, the Heir may  be barr'd? And infinite more of the like complicated Questions.  And herein the Rule of Decision is, First, the Common Law and  Custom of the Realm, which is the great Substratum that is to be  maintain'd; and then Authorities or Decisions of former Times in  the same or the like Cases, and then the Reason of the Thing  itself.      Thirdly, Or they are such as seem to have no other Guide but  the common Reason of the Thing, unless the same Point has been  formally decided, as in the Exposition of the Intention of  Clauses in Deeds, Wills, Covenants, &c. where the very Sense of  the Words, and their Positions and Relations, give a rational  Account of the Meaning of the Parties, and in such Cases the  Judge does much better herein, than what a bare grave Grammarian  or Logician, or other prudent Men could do; for in many Cases  there have been former Resolutions, either in Point or agreeing  in Reason or Analogy with the Case in Question; or perhaps also,  the Clause to be expounded is mingled with some Terms or Clauses  that require the Knowledge of the Law to help out with the  Construction or Exposition: Both which do often happen in the  same Case, and therefore it requires the Knowledge of the Law to  render and expound such Clauses and Sentences; and doubtless a  good Common Lawyer is the best Expositor of such Clauses, &c.  Vide Plowden, 122, to 130, 140, &c.      V. How the Common Law of England stood at and for some Time after  the coming in of King William I        It is the Honour and Safety, and therefore the just Desire of  Kingdoms that recognize no Superior but God, that their Laws have  those two Qualifications, viz. 1st. That they be not dependent  upon any Foreign Power; for a Dependency in Laws derogates from  the Honour and Integrity of the Kingdom, and from the Power and  Sovereignty of the Prince thereof. Secondly, That they taste not  of Bondage or Servitude; for that derogates from the Dignity of  the Kingdom, and from the Liberties of the People thereof.      In Relation to the former Consideration, the Kings of this  Realm, and their great Councils, have always been jealous and  careful, that they admitted not any Foreign Power, (especially  such as pretended Authority to improve Laws upon other free  Kingdoms or States) nor to countenance the Admission of such Laws  here as were derived from such a Power.      Rome, as well Ancient as Modern, pretended a kind of  universal Power and Interest; the former by their Victories,  which were large, and extended even to Britain itself; and the  later upon the Pretence of being Universal Bishop or  Vicar-General in all Matters Ecclesiastical; so that upon  Pretence of the former, the Civil Law, and upon Pretence of the  later, the Canon Law was introduc'd, or pretended to some Kind of  Right in the Territories of some absolute Princes, and among  others here in England: But this kingdom has been always very  jealous of giving too much Countenance to either of those Laws,  and has always shewn a just Indignation and Resentment against  any Encroachments of this Kind, either by the one Law or the  other. It is true, as before is shewn, that in the Admiralty and  Military Courts, the Civil Law has been admitted, and in the  Ecclesiastical Courts, the Canon Law has been in some Particulars  admitted. But still they carry such Marks and Evidences about  them, whereby it may be known that they bind not, nor have the  Authority of Laws from themselves, but from the authoritative  Admission of this Kingdom.      And, as thus the Kingdom, for the Reasons before given, never  admitted the Civil or the Canon Law to be the Rule of the  Administration of Common Justice in this Kingdom; so neither has  it endured any Laws to be imposed upon the People by any Right of  Conquest, as being unsuitable to the Honour or Liberty of the  English Kingdom, to recognize their Laws as given them at the  Will and Pleasure of a Conqueror. And hence it was, that altho'  the People unjustly assisted King Hen. 4 in his Usurpation of the  Crown, yet he was not admitted thereunto, until he had declared,  that he claimed not as a Conqueror, but as a Successor; only he  reserved to himself the Liberty of extending a Pretence of  Conquest against the Scroops that were slain in Battle against  him; which yet he durst not rest upon without a Confirmation in  Parliament. Vide Rot. Parl. 1 H. 4. No. 56. & Pars 2. Ibid. No  17.      And upon the like Reason it was, That King William I tho' he  be called the Conqueror, and his attaining the Crown here, is  often in History, and in some Records, called Conquestus Angliae;  yet in Truth it was not such a Conquest as did, or could alter  the Laws of this Kingdom, or impose Laws upon the People Per  Modum Conquestus, or Jure Belli: And therefore, to wipe off that  false Imputation upon our Laws, as if they were the Fruit or  Effect of a Conquest, or carried in them the Badge of Servitude  to the Will of the Conqueror, which Notion some ignorant and  prejudiced Persons have entertain'd; I shall rip up, and lay open  this whole Business from the Bottom, and to that End enquire into  the following Particulars, viz.        1. Of the Thing called Conquest, what it is, when attained,  and the Rights thereof.      2. Of the several Kinds of Conquest, and their Effects, as to  the Alteration of Laws by the Victor.      3. How the English Laws stood at the Entry of King William  the First.      4. By what Title he entred, and whether by such a Right of  Conquest as did, or could, alter the English Laws.      5. Whether De Facto there was any Alteration of the said  Laws, and by what Means after his coming in.        First, Touching the first of these, viz. Conquest, what it  is, when attain'd, and the Rights thereof. It is true, That it  seems to be admitted as a kind of Law among all Nations, That in  Case of a Solemn War between Supream Princes, the Conqueror  acquires a Right of Dominion, as well as a Property over the  Things and Persons that are fully conquered; and the Reasons  assign'd are Principally these, viz.      1st. Because both Parties have apealed to the highest  Tribunal that can be, viz. The Trial by War, wherein the great  Judge and Sovereign of the World, The Lord of Hosts, seems in a  more especial Manner than in other Cases to decide the  Controversy. 2dly. Because unless this should be a final  Decision, Mankind would be destroy'd by endless Broils, Wars and  Contentions; therefore, for the Preservation of Mankind, this  great Decision ought to be final, and the conquer'd ought to  acquiesce in it. 3dly. Because if this should not be admitted,  and be by, as it were, the tacit Consent of Mankind accounted a  lawful Acquisition, there would not be any Security or Peace  under any Government: For by the various Revolutions of Dominion  acquired by this Means, have been, and are to this Day the  Successions of Kingdoms and States preserved. What was once the  Romans, was before that the Graecians, and before them the  Persians, and before the Persians, the Assyrians; and if this  just Victory were not allowed to be a firm Acquest of Dominion,  the present Possessors would be still obnoxious to the Claim of  the former Proprietors, and so they would be in a restless State  of Doubts, Difficulties and Changes upon the Pretention of former  Claims: Therefore, to cut off this Instability and Unsettledness  in Dominion and Property, it would seem that the common Consent  of all Nations has tacitly submitted, that Acquisition by Right  of Conquest, in a Solemn War between Persons not Subjects of each  other by Bonds of Allegiance or Fidelity, should be allowed as  one of the lawful Titles of acquiring Dominion over the Persons,  Places and Things so conquer'd.      But whatever be the real Truth or Justice of this Position,  yet we are much at a Loss touching the Things in Hypothesi, viz.  Whether this be the Effect of every Kind of Conquest? Whether the  War be Just or Unjust? What are the Requisites to the  Constituting of a just War? Who are the Persons that may acquire?  And what are the Solemnities requisite for that Acquest? But  above all, the greatest Difficulty is, when there shall be said,  Such a Victory as acquires this Right? Indeed, if there be a  total Deletion of every Person of the Opposing Party or Country,  then the Victory is compleat, because none remains to call it in  Question. But suppose they are beaten in one Battle, may they not  rally again? Or if the greater Part be subdued, may not the  lesser keep their Ground? Or if they do not at the present, may  they not in the next Age regain their Liberty? Or if they be  quiet for a Time, may they not as they have Opportunity, renew  their Pretentions? And altho' the Victor, by his Power, be able  to quell and suppress them, yet he is beholden to his Sword for  it, and the Right that he got by his Victory before, would not be  sufficient without a Power and Force to establish and secure him  against new Troubles. And on the other Side, if those few subdu'd  Persons can by Force regain what they once had a Pretence to, a  former Victory will be but a weak Defence; and if it would, they  would have the like Pretence to a Claim of Acquest by Victory  over him, as he had over them.      It seems therefore a difficult Thing to determine in what  indivisible Moment this Victory is so compleat, that Jure Belli  the Acquest of Dominion is fully gotten, and therefore Victors  use to secure themselves against Disputes of that Kind, and as it  were to under-pin their Acquest Jure Belli, that they might not  be lost by the same Means, whereby they were gained by the  Continuation of eternal Forces of Standing Armies, Castles,  Garrisons, Munitions, and other Acts of Power and Force, so as  thereby to over-bear and prevent an ordinary Possibility of the  Prevailing of the conquered or subdued People, against the  Conqueror or Victor. He that lays the Weight of his Title upon  Victory or Conquest, rarely rests in it as a compleat Conquest,  till he has added to it somewhat of Consent or Faith of the  conquered, submitting voluntarily to him, and then, and not till  then, he thinks his Title secure, and his Conquest compleat: And  indeed, he has no Reason to think his Title can be otherwise  secure; for where the Title is meerly Force or Power, his Title  will fail, if the conquered can with like Force or Power  over-match his, and to regain their former Interest or Dominion.      Now this Consent is of Two Kinds, either Express'd, or  Imply'd. An express Consent is, when after a Victory the Party  conquered do expresly submit themselves to the Victors, either  simply or absolutely, by Dedition, yielding themselves, giving  him their Faith and their Allegiance; or else under certain  Pacts, Conventions, Agreements, or Capitulations, as when the  subdued Party, either by themselves, or by Substitutes, or  Delegates by them chosen, do yield their Faith and their  Allegiance to the Victor upon certain Pacts or Agreements between  them; as for holding or continuing their Religion, their Laws,  their Form of Civil Administration, &c.      And thus, tho' Force were perhaps the Occasion of this  Consent, yet in Truth 'tis Consent only that is the true  proximate and fix'd Foundation of the Victor's Right; which now  no longer rests barely upon external Force, but upon the express  Consent and Pact of the subdu'd People, and consequently this  Pact or Convention is that which is to be the immediate  Foundation of that Dominion; and upon a &iligent Observation of  Most Acquests gotten by Conquest, or so called, we shall find  this to be the Conclusion of almost all Victories, they end in  Deditions and Capitulations, and Faith given to the Conqueror,  whereby oftentimes the former Laws, Privileges, and Possessions  are confirmed to the Subdued, without which the Victors seldom  continue long or quiet in their New Acquests, without extream  Expence, Force, Severity and Hazard.      An implied Consent is, when the Subdued do continue for a  long Time quiet and peaceable under the Government of the Victor,  accepting his Government, submitting to his Laws, taking upon  them the Offices and Employments under him, and obeying and  owning him as their Governor, without opposing him, or claiming  their former Right. This seems to be a tacit Acceptance of, and  Assent to him; and tho' this is gradual, and possibly no  determinate Time is stinted, wherein a Man can say, this Year, or  this Month, or this Day, such a tacit Consent was compleated and  concluded: For Circumstances may make great Variations in the  Sufficiency of the Evidence of such an Assent; yet by a long and  quiet Tract of peaceable Submission to the Laws and Government of  the Victor, Men may reasonably conjecture, that the conquered  have relinquished their Purpose of regaining by Force what by  Force they lost.      But still all this is intended of a lawful Conquest by a  Foreign Prince or State, and not an Usurpation by a Subject,  either upon his Prince or Fellow Subject; for several Ages and  Discents do not purge the Unlawfulness of such an Usurpation.      Secondly. Concerning the several Kinds of Conquests, and  their Effects, as to the Alteration of Laws by the Victor. There  seems to be a double kind of Conquest, which induces a various  Consideration touching the Change of Laws, viz. Victoria in Regem  & Populum, & Victoria in Regem tantum. The Conquest over the  People or Country, is when the War is denounced by a Prince or  State Foreign, and no Subject, and when the Intention and  Denunciation of the War is against the King and People or  Country, and the Pretention of Title is by the Sword, or Jure  Belli; such were most of the Conquests of ancient Monarchs, viz.  The Assyrian, Persian, Graecian, and Roman Conquests; and in such  Cases, the Acquisitions of the Victor were absolute and  universal, he gain'd the Interest and Property of the very Soil  of the Country subdued; which the Victor might, at his Pleasure,  give, fell or arrent: He gain'd a Power of abolishing or changing  their Laws and Customs, and of giving New, or of imposing the Law  of the Victor's Country. But although this the Conqueror might  do, yet a Change of the Laws of the conquered Country was rarely  universally made, especially by the Romans: Who, though in their  own particular Colonies planted in conquered Countries, they  observed the Roman Law, which possibly might by Degrees, without  any rigorous Imposition, gain and insinuate themselves into the  conquered People, and so gradually obtain, and insensibly conform  them, at least so many of them as were conterminous to the  Colonies and Garrisons to the Roman Laws; yet they rarely made a  rigorous and universal Change of the Laws of the conquered  Country, unless they were such as were foreign and barbarous, or  altogether inconsistent with the Victor's Government: But in  other Things, they commonly indulged unto the conquered, the Laws  and Religion of their Country upon a double Account, viz.        First. On Account of Humanity, thinking it a hard and  oversevere Thing to impose presently upon the conquered a Change  of their Customs, which long Use had made dear to them. And,  2dly. Upon the Account of Prudence; for the Romans being a wise  and experienced People, found that those Indulgences made their  Conquests the more easy, and their Enjoyments thereof the more  firm, when as a rigorous Change of the Laws and Religion of the  People would render them in a restless and unquiet Condition, and  ready to lay hold of any Opportunity of Defection or Rebellion,  to regain their ancient Laws and Religion, which ordinary People  count most dear to them; (though at this Day the Indulgence of a  Paganish Religion is not used to be allowed by any Christian  Victor, as is observed in Calvin's Case in the Seventh Report;)  and to give One Instance for all, it was upon this Account, That  though the Romans had wholly subdued Syria and Palestina, yet  they allow'd to the Inhabitants the Jews, &c. the Use of their  Religion and Laws, so far forth as consisted with the Safety and  Security of the Victor's Interest: And therefore, though they  reserved to themselves the Cognizance of such Causes as concern'd  themselves, their Officers or Revenues, and such Cases as might  otherwise disturb the Security of their Empire, as Treasons,  Insurrections, and the like; yet 'tis evident they indulged the  People of the Jews, &c. to judge by their own Law, not only of  some Criminal Proceedings, but even of Capital in some Cases, as  appears by the History of the Gospels, and Acts of the Apostles.      But still this was but an Indulgence, and therefore was  resumable by the Victor, unless there intervened any Capitulation  between the Conqueror and the Conquered to the contrary. which  was frequent, especially in those Cases, when it was not a  compleat Conquest, but rather a Dedition upon Terms and  Capituiations, agreed between the Conqueror and the Conquered;  wherein usually the yielding Party secured to themselves, by the  Articles of their Dedition, the Enjoyment of their Laws and  Religion; and then by the Laws of Nature and of Nations, both  which oblige in the Observation of Faith and Promises, those  Terms and Capitulations, were to be observed. Again, 2dly. When  after a full Conquest, the conquered People resumed so much  Courage and Power as began to put them into a Capacity of  regaining their former Laws and Liberties. This commonly was the  Occasion of Terms and Capitulations between the Conquerors and  Conquered. Again, 3dly. When by long Succession of Time, the  Conquered had either been incorporated with the conquering  People, whereby they had worn out the very Marks and  Discriminations between the Conquerors and Conquered; and if they  continued distinct, yet by a long Prescription, Usage and Custom,  the Laws and Rights of the conquered People were in a Manner  settled, and the long Permission of the Conquerors amounted to a  tacite Concession or Capitulation, for the Enjoyment of their  Laws and Liberties.        But of this more than enough is said, because it will appear  in what follows, That William I never made any such Conquest of  England.        Secondly, Therefore I come to the Second Kind of Conquest,  viz. That which is only Victoria in Regem: And this is where the  Conqueror either has a real Right to the Crown or chief  Government of a Kingdom, or at least has, or makes some Pretence  of Claim thereunto; and, in Pursuance of such Claim, raises War,  and by his Forces obtains what he so pretends a Title to. Now  this Kind of Conquest does only instate the Victor in those  Rights of Government, which the conquered Prince, or that Prince  to whom the Conqueror pretends a Right of Succession, had;  whereby he becomes only a Successor Jure Belli, but not a Victor  or Conqueror upon the People; and therefore has no more Right of  altering their Laws, or taking away their Liberties or  Possessions, than the conquered Prince, or the Prince to whom he  pretends a Right of Succession, had; for the Intention, Scope and  Effect of his Victory extends no further than the Succession, and  does not at all affect the Rights of the People. The Conqueror  is, as it were, the Plaintiff, and the conquered Prince is the  Defendant, and the Claim is a Claim of Title to the Crown; and  because each of them pretends a Right to the Sovereignty, and  there is no other competent Trial of the Title between them, they  put themselves upon the great Trial by Battle; wherein there is  nothing in Question touching the Rights of the People, but only  touching the Right of the Crown, and that being decided by the  Victory, the Victor comes in as a Successor, and not Jure  Victoriae, as in relation to the Peoples Rights; the most Sacred  whereof are their Laws and Religion.      Indeed, those that do voluntarily assist the conquered  Prince, commonly undergo the same Hazard with him, and do, as it  were, put their Interest upon the Hazard and Issue of the same  Trial, and therefore commonly fall under the same Severity with  the conquered, at least de facto; because, perchance the Victor  thinks he cannot be secure without it: But yet Usage, and indeed  common Prudence, makes the Conquerors use great Moderation and  Discrimination in relation to the Assistants of the conquered  Prince; and to extend this Severity only to the eminent and busy  Assistants of the Conquered, and not to the Gregarii, or such as  either by Constraint or by Necessity were enforced to serve  against him; and as to those also, on whom they exercise their  Power, it has been rarely done Jure Belli aut Victoriae, but by a  judiciary Proceeding, as in Cases of Treason, because now the  great Title by Battle has pronounced for the Right of the  Conqueror, and at best no Man must dare to say otherwise now,  whatsoever Debility was in his Pretension or Claim. We shall see  the Instances hereof in what follows.        Thirdly, As to the Third Point, How the Laws of England stood  at the entry of King William I and it seems plain, that at the  Time of his Entry into England, the Laws, commonly call'd, The  Laws of Edward the Confessor, were then the standing Laws of the  Kingdom. Hoveden tells us, in a Digression under his History of  King Henry 2 that those Laws were originally put together by King  Edgar, who was the Confessor's Grandfather, viz.        Verum tamen post mortem ipsius Regis Edgari usq; ad  Coronationem Sancti Regis Edvardi quod-Tempus Continet Sexaginta  & Septem Annos prece (vel pretio) Leges sopitae sunt & Jus  praetermissae sed postquam Rex Edvardus in Regno fuit sublimatus  Concilio Baronum Angliae Legem Annos Sexaginta & Septem Sopitam,  excitavit & confirmavit, & ea lex sic confirmata vocata est Lex  Sancti Edvardi, non quod ipse prius invenisset eam sed cum  praetermissa fuisset & oblivioni penitus dedita a morte avi sui  Regis Edgari qui primus inventor ejus fuisse dicitur usque ad sua  Tempora, viz. Sexaginta & Septem Annos.        And the same Passage in totidem Verbis is in the History of  Litchfield, cited in Sir Robert Twisden's Prologue to the Laws of  King William I. But although possibly those Laws were collected  by King Edgar, yet it is evident, by what is before said, they  were augmented by the Confessor, by that Extract of Laws  beforementioned, which he made out of that Threefold Law, that  obtain'd in several Parts of England, viz. The Danish, the  Mercian, and the West-Saxon Laws.      This Manual (as I may call it) of Laws, stiled, The  Confessor's Laws, was but a finall Volume, and contains but few  Heads, being rather a Scheme or Directory touching some Method to  be observed in the Distribution of Justice, and some particular  Proceedings relative thereunto, especially in Matters of Crime,  as appears by the Laws themselves, which are now printed in Mr  Lambart's Saxon Laws, p. 133. and other Places; yet the English  were very jealous for them, no less or otherwise than they are at  this Time for the Great Charter; insomuch, that they were never  satisfied till the said Laws were reinforced and mingled for the  most Part with the Coronation Oath of King William I and some of  his Successors.        And this may serve shortly touching this Third Point, whereby  we see that the Laws that obtain'd at the Time of the Entry of  King William I were the English Laws, and principally those of  Edward the Confessor.        Fourthly, The Fourth Particular is, The Pretensions of King  William I to the Crown of England, and what kind of Conquest he  made; and this will be best rendered and understood by producing  the History of that Business, as it is delivered over to us by  the ancient Historians that lived in Or near that Time: The Sum,  or Totum whereof, is this.      King Edward the Confessor having no Children, nor like to  have any, had Three Persons related to him, whom he principally  favoured, viz. 1st. Edgar Aetheling, the Son of Edward, the Son  of Edmond Ironside, Mat. Paris, Anno 1066. Edmundus aiutem latus  serreum Rex naturalis de stirpe Regum genuit Edwardum & Edwardus  genuit Edgarum cui dejure debebatur Regnum Anglorum. 2dly.  Harold, the Son of Goodwin, Earl of Kent, the Confessor's  Father-in-Law, he having married Earl Goodwin's Daughter: And  3dly, William Duke of Normandy, who was allied to the Confessor  thus, viz. William was the Son of Robert, the Son of Richard Duke  of Normandy, which Richard was Brother unto the Confessor's  Mother. Vide Hoveden, sub initio Anni primi Willielmi primi.      There was likewise a great Familiarity, as well as this  Alliance, between the Confessor and Duke William; for the  Confessor had often made considerable Residencies in Normandy.  And this gave a fair Expectation to Duke William of succeeding  him in this Kingdom: And there was also, at least pretended, a  Promise made him by the Confessor, That Duke William should  succeed him in the Crown of England; and because Harold was in  great Favour with the King, and of great Power in England, and  therefore the likeliest Man by his Assistance to advance, or by  his Opposition to hinder or temperate the Duke's Expectation,  there was a Contract made between the Duke and Harold in Normandy  in the Confessor's Lifetime, That Harold should, after the  Confessor's Death, assist the Duke in obtaining the Crown of  England. (Vide Brompton, Hoveden, &c.) Shortly after which the  Confessor died, and then stepp'd up the Three Competitors to the  Crown, viz.      1. Edgar Aetheling, who was indeed favoured by the Nobility,  but being an Infant, was overborn by the Power of Harold, who  thereupon began to set up for himself: Whereupon Edgar, with his  Two Sisters, fled into Scotland; where he, and one of his  Sisters, dying without Issue, Margaret, his other Sister and  Heir, married Malcolm, King of Scots; from whence proceeded the  Race of the Scottish Kings.      2. Harold, who having at first raised a Power under Pretence  of supporting and preserving Duke William's Title to this  Kingdom, and having by Force suppress'd Edgar, he thereupon  claimed the Crown to himself; and pretending an Adoption or  Bequest of the Kingdom upon him by the Confessor, he forgot his  Promise made to Duke William, and usurped the Crown, which he  held but the Space of 9 Months and 4 Days. Hoveden.      3. William, Duke of Normandy, who pretended a Promise of  Succession by the Confessor, and a Capitulation or Stipulation by  Harold for his Assistance; and had, it seems, so far interested  the Pope in Favour of his Pretensions, that he pronounced for  William against both the others.      Hereupon the Duke makes his Claim to the Crown of England,  gathered a powerful Army, and came over, and upon the 14th of  October, Anno 1067, gave Harold Battle, and overthrew him at that  Place in Sussex, where William afterwards founded Battle-Abby, in  Memory of that Victory; and then he took upon him the Government  of the Kingdom, as King thereof, and upon Christmas following was  solemnly crown'd at Westminster by the Archbishop of York; and he  declared at his Coronation, That he claimed the Crown not Jure  Belli, but Jure Successionis; and Brompton gives us this Account  thereof, Cum nomen Tyranni exhorresceret & nomen legitimi  principis induere vellet petiit consecrari; and accordingly, says  the same Author, the Archbishop of York, in respect of some  present incapacity in the Archbishop of Canterbury, Munus hoc  adimplevit ipsumque Gulielmum Regem ad jura Ecclesiae Anglicanae  tuenda & conservanda populumque suum recte regendum, & Leges  rectas Statuendumi, Sacramento Solemniter adstrinxit; and  thereupon he took the Homage of the Nobility.      This being the true, though short Account of the State of  that Business, there necessarily follows from thence those plain  and unquestionable Consequences,        First, That the Conquest of King William I was not a Conquest  upon the Country or People, but only upon the King of it, in the  Person of Harold, the Usurper; for William I came in upon a  Pretence of Title of Succession to the Confessor; and the  Prosecution and Success of the Battle he gave to Harold was to  make good his Claim of Succession, and to remove Harold, as an  unlawful Usurper upon his Right; which Right was now decided in  his Favour, and determined by that great Trial by Battle.      Secondly, That he acquired in Consequence thereof no greater  Right than what was in the Confessor, to whom he pretended a  Right of Succession; and therefore could no more alter the Laws  of the Kingdom upon the Pretence of Conquest, than the Confessor  himself might, or than the Duke himself could have done, had he  been the true and rightful Successor to the Crown, in Point of  Descent from the Confessor; neither is it material, whether his  Pretence were true or false, or whether, if true, it were  available or not, to entitle him to the Crown; for whatsoever it  was, it was sufficient to direct his Claim, and to qualify his  Victory so, that the Jus Belli thereby acquired could be only  Victoria in Regem, sed non in Populum, and put him only in the  State, Capacity and Qualification of a Successor to the King, and  not as Conqueror of the Kingdom.      Thirdly, And as this his antecedent Claim kept his Acquest  within the Bounds of a Successor, and restrained him from the  unlimited Bounds and Power of a Conqueror; so his subsequent  Coronation, and the Oath by him taken, is a further  unquestionable Demonstration, that he was restrain'd within the  Bounds of a Successor, and not enlarged with the Latitude of a  Victor; for at his Coronation he binds himself by a solemn Oath  to preserve the Rights of the Church, and to govern according to  the Laws, and not absolutely and unlimitedly according to the  Will of a Conqueror.      Fourthly, That if there were any Doubt whether there might be  such a Victory as might give a Pretension to him, of altering  Laws, or governing as a Conqueror; yet to secure from that  possible Fear, and to avoid it, he ends his Victory in a  Capitulation; namely, he takes the ancient Oath of a King unto  the People, and the People reciprocally giving or returning him  that Assurance that Subjects ought to give their Prince, by  performing their Homage to him as their King, declared by the  Victory he had obtain'd over the Usurper, to be the Successor of  the Confessor: And consequently, if there might be any Pretence  of Conquest over the People's Rights, as well as over Harold's,  yet the Capitulation or Stipulation removes the Claim or Pretence  of a Conqueror, and enstates him in the regulated Capacity and  State of a Successor. And upon all this it is evident, That King  William I could not abrogate or alter the ancient Laws of the  Kingdom, any more than if he had succeeded the Confessor as his  lawful Heir, and had acquir'd the Crown by the peaceable Course  of Descent, without any Sword drawn.      And thus much may suffice, to shew that King William I did  not enter by such a Right of Conquest, as did or could alter the  Laws of this Kingdom.      Therefore I come to the last Question I proposed to be  considered, viz. Whether de Facto there was anything done by King  William I after his Accession to the Crown, in Reference either  to the Alteration or Confirmation of the Laws, and how and in  what Manner the same was done: And this being a Narrative of  Matters of Fact, I shall divide into those Two Inquiries, viz.  1st. What was done in Relation to the Lands and Possessions of  the English: And 2dly, What was done in Relation to the Laws of  the Kingdom in general; for both of these will be necessary to  make up a clear Narrative touching the Alteration or Suspension,  Confirmation or Execution of the Laws of this Kingdom by him.      First, Therefore touching the former, viz. What was done in  Relation to the Lands and Possessions of the English. Those Two  Things must be premised, viz. First, a Matter of Right, or Law;  which is this, That in Case this had been a Conquest upon the  Kingdom, it had been at the Pleasure of the Conqueror to have  taken all the Lands of the Kingdom into his own Possession, to  have put a Period to all former Titles, to have cancelled all  former Grants, and to have given, as it were, the Date and  Original to every Man's Claim, so as to have been no higher nor  ancienter than such his Conquest, and to hold the same by a Title  derived wholly from and under him. I do not say, that every  absolute Conqueror of a Kingdom will do thus, but that he may if  he will, and have Power to effect it.      Secondly, The Second Thing to be premised is, a Matter of  Fact, which is this; That Duke William brought in with him a  great Army of Foreigners, that would have expected a Reward of  their Undertaking, and therefore were doubtless very craving and  importunate for Gratifications to be made them by the Conqueror.  Again, it is very probable, that of the English themselves, there  were Persons of very various Conditions and Inclinations; some  perchance did adhere to the Duke, and were assistant to him  openly, or at least under-hand, towards the bringing him in; and  those were sure to enjoy their Possessions privately and quietly  when the Duke prevailed. Again, some did, without all question,  adhere to Harold, and those in all Probability were severely  dealt with, and dispossess'd of their Lands, unless they could  make their Peace. Again, possibly there were others who assisted  Harold, partly out of Fear and Compulsion; yet those, possibly,  if they were of any Note or Eminence, fared little better than  the rest. Again, there were some that probably stood Neuters, and  medled not; and those, though they could not expect much Favour,  yet they might in Justice expect to enjoy their own. Again, it  must needs be supposed, That the Duke having so great an Army of  Foreigners, so many ambitious and covetous Minds to be satisfied,  so many to be rewarded in Point of Gratitude; and after so great  a Concussion as always happens upon the Event of a Victory, it  must needs, upon those and such like Accounts, be evident to any  Man that considers Things of this Nature, that there were great  Outrages and Oppressions comwitted by the Victor's Soldiers and  their Officers, many false Accusations made against innocent  Persons, great Disturbances and Evictions of Possessions, many  right Owners being unjustly thrown out, and consequently many  Occupations and Usurpations of other Men's Rights and  Possessions, and a long while before those Things could be  reduced to any quiet and regular Settlement.        These general Observations being premised, we will now see  what de Facto was done in Relation to Men's Possessions, in  Consequence of this Victory of the Duke.        First, It is certain that he took into his Hands all the  Demesn Lands of the Crown which were belonging to Edward the  Confessor at the Time of his Death, and avoided all the  Dispositions and Grants thereof made by Harold, during his short  Reign; and this might be one great End of his making that noble  Survey in the fourth year of his Reign, called generally  Doomsday-Read, in some Records, as Rot. Winton, &c. thereby to  ascertain what were the Possessions of the Crown in the Time of  the Confessor, and those he entirely resumed: And this is the  Reason why in some of our old Books it is said, Ancient Demesn is  that which was held by King William the Conqueror; and in others  'tis said, Ancient Demesn is that which was held by King Edward  the Confessor, and both true in their Kind; and in this Respect,  viz. That whatsoever appeared to be the Confessor's at the Time  of his Death, was assumed by King William into his own  Possession.      Secondly, It is also certain, That no Person simply, and  quatenus an English Man, was dispossess'd of any of his  Possessions, and consequently their Land was not pretended unto  as acquired Jure Belli, which appears most plainly by the  following Evidences, viz.        First, That very many of those Persons that were possessed of  Lands in the Time of Edward the Confessor, and so returned upon  the Book of Doomsday, retain'd the same unto them and their  Descendants, and some of their Descendants retain the same  Possessions to this Day, which could not have been, if presently  Jure Belli ac Vicioriae universalis, the Lands of the English had  been vested in the Conqueror. And again,      Secondly, We do find, that in all Times, even suddenly after  the Conquest, the Charters of the ancient Saxon Kings were  pleaded and allowed, and Titles made and created by them to  Lands, Liberties, Franchises and Regalities, affirm'd and  adjudg'd under William I. Yea, when that Exception has been  offered, That by the Conquest those Charters had lost their  Force, yet those Claims were allowed as in 7 E. 3. Fines, as  mentioned by Mr Selden, in his Notes upon Eadmerus, which could  not be, if there had been such a Conquest as had vested all Mens  Rights in the Conqueror.      Thirdly, Many Recoveries were had shortly after this  Conquest, as well by Heirs as Successors of the Seisin of their  Predecessors before the Conquest. We shall take one or two  Instances for all; namely, that famous Record apud Pinendon, by  the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Time of King William I of  the Seisin and Title of his Predecessors before the Conquest: See  the whole Process and Proceedings thereupon in the End of Mr  Selden's Notes upon Eadmerus; and see Spelman's Glossary, Title  Drenches. Upon these Instances, and much more that might be  added, it is without Contradiction, That the Rights and  Inheritances of the English qua Tales, were not abrogated or  impeach'd by this Conquest, but continued notwithstanding the  same; for, as is before observ'd, it was Jure Belli quoad Regem,  sed non quoad Populum.      But to descend to some Particulars: The English Persons that  the Conqueror had to deal with, were of Three Kinds, viz. First,  Such as adhered to him aginst Harold the Usurper; and, without  all Question, those continued the Possession of their Lands, and  their Possessions were rather increased by him, than any way  diminished. Secondly, Such as adhered to Harold, and opposed the  Duke, and fought against him; and doubtless, as to those, the  Duke after his Victory used his Power, and dispossess'd them of  their Estates: Which Thing is usual upon all Conclusions and  Events of this Kind, upon a double Reason; 1st, To secure himself  against the Power of those that oppos'd him, and to weaken them  in their Estates, that they should not afterwards be enabled to  make Head against him. And, 2dly, To gratify those that assisted  him, and to reward their Services in that Expedition; and to make  them firm to his Interest, which was now twisted with their own:  For it can't be imagined, but that the Conqueror was assisted  with a great Company of Foreigners, some that he favour'd, some  that had highly deserved for their Valour, some that were  necessitous Soldiers of Fortune, and others that were either  ambitious or covetous: All whose Desires, Deserts, or  Expectations, the Conqueror had no other Means to satisfy, but by  the Estates of such as had appeared open Enemies to him; and  doubtless, many innocent Persons suffered in this Kind, under  false Suggestions and Accusations, which occasioned great  Exclamations by the Writers of those Times against the Violences  and Oppressions which were used after this Victory. And, Thirdly,  Such as stood Neuters, and meddled not on either Side during the  Controversy: And doubtless, for some Time after this great  Change, many of those suffered very much, and were hardly used in  their Estates, especially such as were of the more eminent Sort.      Gervasius Tilburiensis, who wrote in the Time of Hen. 2.  Libro I. Cap. Quid Murdrum & quare sic dictum, gives us a large  Account of what he had traditionally learned touching this  Matter, to this Effect, viz. "Post Regni Conquisitionem &  Perduellium Subjectionem, &c. Nomine autem Successionis a  temporibus subactae Gentis nihil sibi Vendicarent," &c. i. e.  After the Conquest of the Kingdom, and Subjection of the Rebels,  when the King himself and his great Men had surveyed their new  Acquisitions; and strict Inquiry was made, who there were that,  fighting against the King, had saved themselves by Flight; From  these, and the Heirs of such as were slain in Battle, fighting  against him, all Hopes of Succession, or of possessing their  Estates, were lost; for the People being subdued, they held their  Lives as a Favour, &c.      But Gervase, as he speaks so liberally in Relation to the  Conquest, and the Subacta Gens, as he terms us; so it should  seem, he was in great Measure mistaken in this Relation: For it  is most plain, That those that were not engaged visibly in the  Assistance of Harold, were not, according to the Rules of those  Times, disabled to enjoy their Possessions, or make Title of  Succession to their Ancestors, or transmit to their Posterity as  formerly, tho' possibly some Oppressions might be used to  particular Persons here and there to the contrary. And this  appears by that excellent Monument of Antiquity, set down in Sir  H. Spelman's Glossary, in the Title of Drenches or Drenges, which  I shall here transcribe, viz.        Edwinus de Sharborne, Et quidam alii qui ejecti fuerunt &  Terris suis abierunt ad conquestorem & dixerunt ei, quod nunquam  ante conquestum, nec in conquestum, nec post, fuerunt contra  Regem ipsum in Concilio, aut in auxilio sed tenuerunt se in pace,  Et hoc parati sunt probare qualiter Rex vellet Ordinare, Per quod  idem Rex facit Inquiri per totam Angliam si ita fuit, quod quidem  probatum fuit, propter quod idem Rex praecepit ut omnes illi qui  sic tenuerunt se in pace in forma praedicta quod ipsi rehaberent  omnes Terras & Dominationes suas adeo integre & in pace ut unquam  habuerent vel tenuerunt ante conquestum suum, Et quod ipsi in  posterum vocarentur Drenges.        But it seems the Possessions of the Church were not under  this Discrimination, for they being held not in Right of the  Person, but of the Church, were not subject to any Confiscation  by the Adherence of the Possessor to Harold the Usurper: And  therefore, tho' it seems Stigand Archbishop of Canterbury, at the  coming in of William I had been in some Opposition against him,  which probably might be the true Cause why he perform'd not the  Office of his Coronation, which of Right belonged to him, tho'  some other Impediments were pretended, Vide Eadmerus in initio  Libri, and might also possibly be the Reason why a considerable  Part of his Possessions were granted to Odo Bishop of Bayonne,  but were afterwards recovered by Lanfrank, his Successor, at  Pinendon, in pleno Comitatu, ubi Rex praecepit totum Comitatum  absque mora considere, & homines Comitatus omnes Francigenos &  praecipue Anglos in antiquis Legibus & Consuetudinibus peritos,  in unum convenire.      To this may be added those several Grants and Charters made  by King William I mentioned in the History of Ely, and in  Eadmerus, for restoring to Bishopricks and Abbies such Lands, or  Goods, as had been taken away from them, viz.        Willielmus Dei gratia Rex Anglorum, Lanfranco Archiepiscopo  Cantuar' & Galfrido Episcopo Constantiarum & Roberto Comiti de ou  & Richardo filio Comitis Gilberti & Hugoni de Monteforti, suisque  aliis proceribus Regni Angliae salutem. Summonete Vicecomites  meos ex meo praecepto, & ex parte mea eis dicite ut reddant  Episcopatibus meis & Abbatiis totum Dominium omnesque Dominicas  terras quas de Domino Episcopatuum meorum, & Abbatiarum, Episcopi  mei & Abbates eis vel lenitate timore vel cupiditate dederunt vel  habere consenserunt vel ipsi violentia sua inde abstraxerunt, &  quod hacteuus injuste possiderunt de Dominio Ecclesiarum mearum.  Et nisi reddiderint sicut eos ex parte mea summonebitis, vos  ipsos velint nolint, constringite reddere; Et quod si quilibet  alius vel aliquis vestrum quibus hanc Justitiam imposui ejusdem  querelae fuerit reddat similiter quod de Domino Episcopatuum vel  Abbatiarum mearum habuit ne propter illud quod inde aliquis  vestrum habebit, minus exerceat super meos Vicecomites vel alios,  quicunque teneant Dominium Ecclesiarum mearum, quod Praecipio,  &c.      Willielmus Rex Anglor' omnibus suis fidelibus suis &  Vicecomitibus in quorum Vicecomitatibus Abbatia de Heli Terras  habet salutem. Praecipio ut Abbatia pred. habeat Omnes  consuetudines suas scilicet Saccham & Socham Toll & Team &  Infanganetheof, Hamsocua, & Grithbrice Fithwite & Ferdwite infra  Burgum & extra & omnes alias forisfacturas in terra sua super  suos homines sicut habuit Die qua Rex Edwardus fuit vivus &  mortuus, & sicut mea jussione dirationatae apud Keneteford per  plures Scyras ante meos Barones, viz. Galfridum Constantientem  Ep. & Baldewine Abbatem, &c. Teste Rogero Bigot.      Willielmus Rex Angl. Lanfranco Archiepo', & Rogero Comiti  Moritoniae, & Galfrido Constantien Epo. salutem. Mando vobis &  Praecipio ut iterum faciatis congregari omnes Scyras quae  interfuerunt placito habito de Terris Ecclesia de Heli, antequam  mea conjux in Normaniam novissime veniret, cum quibus etiam sint  de Baronibus meis, qui competenter adesse poterint & praedicto  placito interfuerint & qui terras ejusdem Ecclesiae tenent;  Quibus in unum congregatis eligantur plures de illis Anglis qui  sciunt quomodo Terrae jacebant praefatae Ecclesiae Die qua Rex  Edwardus Obiit, & quod inde dixerint ididem jure jurando  testentur; quo facto restituentur Ecclesiae terrae quae in  Dominico suo erant die obitus Regis Edwardi; Exceptis his quas  homines clamabant me sibi dedisse; illas vero Literis mihi  significate quae sint, & qui eas tenent; Qui autem tenent  Theinlandes quae proculdubio debent teneri de Ecclesia faciant  concordiam cum Abbate quam Meliorem poterint, & si nolurunt  terrae remaneant ad Ecclesiam, Hoc quoque detinentibus Socham &  Saccam fiat, &c.      Willielmus Rex Anglorum, Lanfranco Archiepisc', & G. Episc. &  R. Comiti M. salutem, &c. Defendite ne Remigius Episcopus novas  consuetudines requirat infra Insulam de Heli, Nolo enim quod ibi  habeat nisi illud quod Antecessor ejus habebat Tempore Regis  Edwar.di Scilicet qua die ipse Rex mortuus est. Et si Remig.  Episcopus inde Placitare voluerit placitet inde sicut fecisset  tempore Regis Edw. & placitum istum sit in vestra praesentia; De  custodia de Norguic Abbatem Simeonem quietum esse demittite; Sed  ibi municionem suam conduci faciat & custodiri. Facite remanere  placitum de Terris quas Calumniantur Willielmus de ou, &  Radulphus filius Gualeranni, & Robertus Gernon; si inde placitare  noluerint sicut inde placitassent temPore Regis Edwardi, & sicut  iu eodem tempore Abbatia consuetudines suas habebat, Volo ut eas  omnio faciatis habere sicut Abbas per Chartas sUas, & per Testes  suos eas deplacitare poterit.        I might add many more Charters to the foregoing, and more  especially those famous Charters in Spelman's Councils, Vol. 2.  Fol. 14. & 165, whereby it appears, That King William I. Communi  Concilio, & Concilio Archiepiscoporum, Episcoporum & Abbatum, &  omnium Principum & Baronum Regni, instituted the Courts for  holding Pleas of Ecclesiastick Causes, to be separate and  distinct from those Courts that had Jurisdiction of Civil Causes.  Sed de his plusquam fatis.      And thus I conclude the Point I first propounded, viz. How  King William I after his Victory, dealt with the Possessions of  the English, whereby it appears that there was no Pretence of an  Universal Conquest, or that he was a Victor in Populum; neither  did he claim the Title of English Lands upon that Account, but  only made Use of his Victory thus far, to seize the Lands of such  as had oppos'd him: Which is universal in all Cases of Victories,  tho' without the Pretence of Conquest.      Secondly, Therefore I come to the Second general Question,  viz. What was done in Relation to the Laws? It is very plain,  that the King, after his Victory, did, as all wise Princes would  have done, endeavour to make a stricter Union between England and  Normandy; and in order thereunto, he endeavoured to bring in the  French instead of the Saxon Language, then used in England:  "Deliberavit" (says Holcot) "quomodo Linguam Saxonicam possit  destruere, & Anglicam & Normanicam idiomate concordare & ideo  ordinavit quod nullus in Curia Regis placitaret nisi in Lingua  Gallica, &c." From whence arose the Practice of Pleading in our  Courts of Law in the Norman or French Tongue, which Custom  continued till the Statute of 36 E. 3. c. 15.      And as he thus endeavoured to make a Community in their  Language, so possibly he might endeavour to make the like in  their Laws, and to introduce the Norman Laws into England, or as  many of 'em as he thought convenient; and it is very probable,  that after the Victory, the Norman Nobility and Soldiers were  scattered through the whole Kingdom, and mingled with the  English, which might possibly introduce some of the Norman Laws  and Customs insensibly into this Kingdom: And to that End the  Conqueror did industriously mingle the English and Normans  together, shuffling the Normans into English Possessions here,  and putting the English into Possessions in Normandy, and making  Marriages among them, especially between the Nobility of both  Nations.      This gave the English a Suspicion, that they should suddenly  have a Change of their Laws before they were aware of it. But it  fell out much better: For first, there arising some Danger of a  Defection of the English, countenanced by the Archbishop of York  in the North, and Frederick, Abbot of St. Albans in the South;  the King, by the Perswasions of Lanfrank, Archbishop of  Canterbury, "Probonopacis apud Berkhamstead juravit super Animas  reliquias Sancti Altani tactisque Sacrosanctis Evangelis  (ministrante juramento Abbate Frederico) ut bonas & approbatas  antiquas Regni Leges quas sancti & pii Angliae Reges ejus  Antecessores, & maxime Rex Edvardus statuit inviolabiliter  observaret; Et sic pacificati ad propria laeti recesserunt." Vide  Mat. Paris, in Vita Frederici Abbatis Sancti Albani.      But altho' now, upon this Capitulation, the ancient English  Laws were confirm'd, and namely, the Laws of St. Edward the  Confessor; yet it appeared not what those Laws were: And  therefore, in the Fourth Year of his Reign, we are told by  Hoveden, in a Digression he makes in his History under the Reign  of King Hen. 2 and also in the Chronicle of Lithfield.        Willielmus Rex, Anno quarto Regni sui Consilio Baronum suorum  fecit Summonari per Universos Consulatos Angliae, Anglos Nobiles  & Sapientes & sua Lege eruditos ut eorum jura & consuetudines ab  ipsis audiret, Electis igitur de singulis totius Patriae  Comitatibus viri duodecim, jurejurando confirmaverunt ut quoad  possint recto tramite neque ad Dextram neque ad Sinistram partem  divertentes Legum suarum consuetudinem & sancitam patef acerent.  nihil praetermittentes nihil addentes, nihil praevaricando  mutantes, &c.        And then sets down many of those ancient Laws approv'd and  confirm'd by the King, and Communi Concilium,. wherein it  appears, that he seems to be most pleased with those Laws that  came under the Title of Lex Danica, as most consonant to the  Norman Customs.        Quo auditu mox universi compatrioti qui Leges dixerint  Tristes effecti, uno ministerio deprecati sunt quatenus  permitteret Leges sibi proprias & consuetudines antiquas habere  in quibus vi%erunt Patres, & ipsi in iis nati & nutriti sunt,  quia durum Valde sibi foret suscipere Leges ignotas, & judicare  de iis quae nesciebant; Rege vero ad flectendum ingrato  existente, tandem eum persecuti sunt deprecantes quatenus pro  Anima Regis Edvardi qui es sub diem suum eis concesserat Barones  & Regnum & cujus orant Leges non aliorum extraneorum cogere quam  sub Legibus perseverare patriis; Unde Consilio habito Praecatui  Baronem tandem acquievit, &c.        Gervasius Tilburiensis, who lived near that Time, speaks  shortly, and to the Purpose, thus: "Propositis Legibus Anglicanis  secundum triplicitam earum Distinctionem, i.e. Merchenlage,  Westsaxon-lage, & Dane-lage quasdam autem approbans illis  transmarinas Legis Neustriae quas ad Regni Pacem tuendam  efficasissime videbantur adjecit."      So that by this, there appears to have been a double  Collection of Laws, viz.      First, The Laws of the Confessor, which were granted and  confirmed by King William, and are also called the Laws of King  William, which are transcribed in Mr Selden's Notes upon  Eadmerus, Page 173. the Title whereof is thus, viz. "Hae sunt  Leges & Consuetudines quas Willielmus Rex concessit universo  populo Angliae post subactam Terram eadem sunt quas Edvardus Rex  cognatus ejus observavit ante eum": And these seem to be the very  same that Ingulfus mentions to have been brought from London, and  placed by him in the Abbey of Crowland in the fifteenth year of  the same King William, attuli eadem Vice mecum Londini in meum  Monasterium Legum Volumen, &c.      Secondly, There were certain additional Laws at that Time  establish'd, which Gervasius Tilburiensis calls, Leges Neustriae  quae ifficacissimae vidibantur ad tuendam Regni Pacim; which  seems to be included in those other Laws of King William  transcribed in the same Notes upon Eadmerus, Pag. 189, 193, &c.  which indeed were principally designed for the Establishment of  King William in the Throne, and for the securing of the Peace of  the Kingdom, especially between the English and Normans, as  appears by these Instances, viz.      The Law de Murdro, or the Common Fine for a Norman or  Frenchman slain, and the offender not discovered: The Law for the  Oath of Allegiance to the King: The Introduction of the Trial by  single Combat, which many Learned Men have thought was not in Use  here in England before Will. 1. And the Law touching Knights  Service, which Bracton, Lib. 2 supposes to be introduced by the  Conqueror, viz.        Quod omnes Comites Milites & Servientes & universi liberi  homines totius Regni habeant & teneant se semper bene in Armis &  in Equis ut decet & quod sint semper prompti & bene parati ad  Servitium suum integrum nobis explendum & peragendum cum semper  Opus affuerit secundum quod nobis de F eodo debent & Tenementis  suis de Jure facere & sicut illis statuimus per Commune Concilium  totius Regini praedicti, & illis dedimus & concessimus in Feodo  jure haereditario.        Wherein we may observe, that this Constitution seems to point  at Two Things, viz. The assizing of Men for Arms, which was  frequent under the Title De assidenda ad Arma, and is afterwards  particularly enforc'd and rectified by the Statute of Winton, 13  Ed. I and next of Conventional Services reserved by Tenures upon  Grants made out of the Crown or Knights Service, called in Latin,  Forinsecum, or Regale Servitium.      And Note, That these Laws were not imposed ad Libitum Regis,  but they were such as were settled Per Commune Concilium Regni,  and possibly at that very Time when Twelve out of every County  were return'd to ascertain the Confessor's Laws, as before is  mentioned out of Hoveden, which appears to be as sufficient and  effectual a Parliament as ever was held in England.      By all which it is apparent, First, That William I did not  pretend, nor indeed could he pretend, notwithstanding this  Nominal Conquest, to alter the Laws of this Kingdom without  common Consent in Communi Concilio Regni, or in Parliament. And,  Secondly, That if there could be any Pretence of any such Right,  or if in that turbulent Time something of that Kind had happened;  yet by all those solemn Capitulations, Oaths, and Concessions,  that Pretence was wholly avoided, and the ancient Laws of the  Kingdom settled, and were not to be altered, or added unto, at  the Pleasure of the Conqueror, without Consent in Parliament.      In the Seventeenth Year of his Reign, (or as some say, the  Fifteenth) he began that great Survey, recorded in Two Books,  called, The Great Doomsday Book, and Little Doomsday Book, and  finished it in the Twentieth year of his Reign, Anno Domini 1086,  as appears by the learned Preface of Mr Selden to Eadmerus, and  indeed by the Books themselves. The Original Record of which is  still extant, remaining in the Custody of the Vice-Chamberlains  of his Majesty's Exchequer. This Record contains a Survey of all  the ancient Demesn Lands of the Kingdom, and contains in many  Manors, not only the Tenants Names, with the Quantity of Lands  and their Values, but likewise the Number and Quality of the  Residents or Inhabitants, with divers Rights, Privileges, and  Customs claimed by them; and being made and found by Verdict or  Presentment of Juries in every Hundred or Division upon their  Oaths, there was no receeding from, or avoiding what was written  in this Record: And therefore as Gervasius Tilburiensis says,  Page 41. "Ob hoc nos eundem Librum Judiciarium Nominamus; Non  quod in eo de propositis aliquibus dubiis seratur sententia, sed  quod ab eo sicut ab ultimo Die Judicii non licet ulla ratione  descedere."      And thus much shall suffice touching the Fifth General Head;  namely, of the Progress made after the Coming-in of King William,  relating to the Laws of England, their Establishment, Settlement,  and Alteration. If any one be minded to see what this Prince did  in reference to Ecclesiasticks, let him consult Eadmerus, and the  learned Notes of Mr. Selden upon it, especially Page 1 67, 168,  &c. where he shall find how this King divided the Episcopal  Consistory from the County Court, and how he restrain'd the  Clergy and their Courts from exercising ecclesiastical  Jurisdiction upon Tenants in Capite.      VI. Concerning the Parity or Similitude of the Laws of England  and Normandy, and the Reasons thereof        The great Similitude that in many Things appears hetween the  Laws of England, and those of Normandy, has given some Occasion  to such as consider not well of Things, to suppose that this  happened by the Power of the Conqueror, in conforming the Laws of  this Kingdom to those of Normandy; and therefore will needs have  it, that our English Laws still retain the Mark of that Conquest,  and that we received our Laws from him as from a Conqueror; than  which Assertion, (as it appears even by what has before been  said) nothing can be more untrue. Besides, if there were any Laws  derived from the Normans to us, as perhaps there might be some,  yea, possibly many; yet it no more concludes the Position to be  true, that we received such Laws Per Modum Conquestus, than if  the Kingdom of England should at this Day take some of the Laws  of Persia, Spain, Egypt, or Assyria, and by Authority of  Parliament settle them here. Which tho' they were for their  Matter Foreign, yet their obligatory Power, and their formal  Nature or Reason of becoming Laws here, were not at all due to  those Countries, whose Laws they were, but to the proper and  intrinsical Authority of this Kingdom by which they were received  as, or enacted into, Laws: And therefore, as no Law that is  Foreign, binds here in England, till it be received and  authoritatively engrafted into the Law of England; so there is no  Reason in common Prudence and Understanding for any Man to  conclude, that no Rule or Method of Justice is to be admitted in  a Kingdom, tho' never so useful or beneficial, barely upon this  Account, That another People entertain'd it, and made it a Part  of their Laws before us.      But as to the Matter itself, I shall consider, and enquire of  the following Particulars, viz.        1. How long the Kingdom of England and Dutchy of Normandy  stood in Conjunction under one Governor.      2. What Evidence we have touching the Laws of Normandy, and  of their Agreement with ours.      3. Wherein consists that Parity or Disparity of the English  and Norman Laws.      4. What might be reasonably judged to be the Reason and  Foundation of that Likeness, which is to be found between the  Laws of both Countries.        First, Touching the Conjunction under one Governor of England  and Normandy, we are to know, That the Kingdom of England and  Dutchy of Normandy were de facto in Conjunction under these  Kings, viz. William I, William 2, Henry I, King Stephen, Henry 2,  and Richard I who, dying without Issue, left behind him Arthur  Earl of Britain, his Nephew, only Son of Geoffry Earl of Britain,  second Brother of Richard I and John the youngest Brother to  Richard I who afterward became King of England by usurping the  Crown from his Nephew Arthur. But the Princes of Normandy still  adhered to Arthur, "sicut Domino Ligeo suo dicentes Judicium &  Consuetudinem esse illarum Regionum ut Arthurus Filius, Fratris  Senioris in Patrimonio sido debito & haereditate Avunculo suo  succedat eodem jure quod Gaulfridus Pater ejus esset habiturus si  Regi Richardo defuncto supervixisset."      And therein they said true, and the Laws of England were the  same, Witness the Succession of Richard 2 to Edward 3 also the  Laws of Germany, and the ancient Saxons were accordant hereunto;  and it was accordingly decided in a Trial by Battle, under Otho  the Emperor, as we are told by Radulphus, de Diceto sub Anno 945.  And such are the Laws of France to this Day, Vide Chopimus de  Domanio Franciae, Lib. 2. Tit. 12. and such were the ancient  Customs of the Normans, as we are told by the Grand Contumier,  cap. 99. And such is the Law of Normandy, and of the Isles of  Jersey and Guernsey (which some Time were Parcel thereof) at this  Day, as is agreed by Terrier, the best Expositor of their  Customs, Lib. 2. cap. 2. And so it was adjudg'd within my  Remembrance in the Isle of Jersey, in a Controversy there,  between John Perchard and John Rowland, for the Goods and Estate  of Peter Perchard.      But nevertheless, John the Uncle of Arthur came by Force and  Power, Et Rotomagum Gladio Diucatus Normanniae accinctus est Per  Ministerium Kotomagensis Archiepiscopi, as Mat. Paris says; and  shortly after also usurped the Crown of England, and imprisoned  his Nephew Arthur, who died in the year 1202, being as was  supposed murthered by his said Uncle, Vide Mat. Paris, in fine  Regni Regis Rici' Primi, and Walsingham in his Ypodigma Neustriae  sub eodem Anno 1202.      And to countenance his Usurpation in Normandy, and to give  himself the better Pretence of Title, he by his Power so far  prevailed there, that he obtained a Change of the Law there,  purely to serve his Turn, by transferring the Right of  Inheritance from the Son of the elder Brother to the younger  Brother, as appears by the Grand Contumier, cap. 99. But withal,  the Gloss takes Notice of it as an Innovation, and brought in by  Men of Power, tho' it mentions not the particular Reason, which  was aforesaid.      The King of France (of whom the Dutchy of Normandy was  holden) highly resented the Injury done by King John to his  Nephew Arthur, who, as was strongly suspected, came not fairly to  his End. He summoned King John as Duke of Normandy into France,  to give an Account of his Actions, and upon his Default of  appearing, he was by King Philip of France forejudged of the Said  Dutchy, Vide Mat. Paris, in initio Regni Johannis; and this  Sentence was so effectually put in Execution, that in the year  1204, Mat Paris tells us, "Tota Normannia, Turania Andegavia, &  Pictavia cum Civitatibus & Castellis & Rebus aliis praeter  Rupellam, Toar, & Mar Castellam sunt in Regis Francorum Dominium  devoluta."      But yet he retained, tho' with much Difficulty, the Islands  of Jersey and Guernsey, and the uninterrupted Possession of some  Parts of Normandy for some Time after, and both he and and his  Son King Hen. 3 kept the Stile and Title of Dukes of Normandy,  &c. 'till the 43d year of King Hen. 3 at which Time for 3000  Livres Tournois, and upon some other Agreements, he resigned  Normandy and Anjou to the King of France, and never afterwards  used that Title, as appears by the Continuation of Mat. Paris,  sub Anno 1260, only the four Islands, some Time Parcel of  Normandy, were still, and to this Day, are enjoyed by the Crown  of England, viz. Jersey, Guernsey, Sarke, and Aldernay, tho' they  are still governed under their ancient Norman Laws.      Secondly, As to the Second Enquiry, What Evidence we have  touching the Laws of Normandy: The best, and indeed only common  Evidence of the ancient Customs and Laws of Normandy, is that  Book which is called, The Grand Contumier of Normandy, which in  later years has been illustrated, not only with a Latin and  French Gloss, but also with the Commentaries of Terrier, a French  Author.      This Book does not only contain many of the ancienter Laws of  Normandy, but most plainly it contains those Laws and Customs  which were in Use here in the Time of King Hen. 2, King Rich. I  and King John, yea, and such also as were in Use and Practice in  that Country after the Separation of Normandy from the Crown of  England; for we shall find therein, in their Writs and Processes,  frequent Mention of King Rich. I and the entire Text of the 110th  Chapter thereof is an Edict of Philip King of France, after the  Severance of Normandy from the Crown of England. (I speak not of  those additional Edicts which are annex'd to that Book of a far  later Date.) So that we are not to take that Book as a Collection  of the Laws of Normandy, as they stood before the Accession or  Union thereof to the Crown of England; but as they stood long  after, under the Time of those Dukes of Normandy that succeeded  William I and it seems to be a Collection made after the Time of  K. Hen. 3 or at least after the Time of K. John, and consequently  it states their Laws and Customs as they stood in Use and  Practice about the Time of that Collection made, which  observation will be of Use in the ensuing Discourse.      Thirdly, Touching the Third Particular, viz. The Agreement  and Disparity of the Laws of England and Normandy. It is very  true, we shall find a great Suitableness in their Laws, in many  Things agreeing with the Laws of England, especially as they  stood in the Time of King Hen. 2 the best Indication whereof we  have in the Collection of Glanville; the Rules of Discents, of  Writs, of Process, of Trials, and some other Particulars, holding  a great Analogy in both Dominions, yet not without their  Differences and Disparities in many Particulars, viz.      First, Some of those Laws are such as were never used in  England; for Instance, There was in Normandy a certain Tribute  paid to the Duke, called Monya, i. e. a certain Sum yielded to  him (in Consideration that he should not alter their Coin)  payable every three years, Vide Contumier, cap. 15. But this  Payment was never admitted in England; indeed it was taken for a  Time, but was ousted by the first Law of King Hen. 1 as an  Usurpation. Again, by the Custom of Normandy, the Lands descended  to the Bastard Eigne, born before Marriage of the same Woman, by  whom the same Man had other Children after Marriage, Contumier,  cap. 27. But the Laws of England were always contrary, as appears  by Glanville, Lib. 7. cap. 13. And the Statute of Merton, which  says, Nolumus Leges Anglicans Mutare, &c. Again, by the Laws of  Normandy, if a Man died without Issue, or Brother, or Sister, the  Lands did descend to the Father, Contumier, cap. 15. Terrier,  cap. 2. But in England, this Law seems never to have been used.      2dly, Again, Some Laws were used in Normandy, which were in  Use in England long before the supposed Norman Conquest, and  therefore could in no Possibility have their original Force, or  any binding Power here upon that Pretence: For Instance, it  appears by the Custumier of Normandy, that the Sheriff of the  County was an Annual Officer, and so 'tis evident he was likewise  in England before the Conquest: And among the Laws of Edward the  Confessor, it is provided, "Quod Aldermanni in Civitatibus eandem  habeant Dignitatem qualem habent Ballivi hundredorum in Ballivis  suis sub Vicecomitem": Again, Wreck of the Sea, and Treasure  Trove was a Prerogative belonging to the Dukes of Normandy, as  appears by the Contumier, cap. 17, & 18. and so it was belonging  to the Crown of England before the Conquest, as appears by the  Charter of Edward the Confessor to the Abby or Ramsey of the  Manor of Ringstede, cum toto ejectu Maris quod Wreccum dicitur,  and the like, vide ibid. of Treasure Trove, & vide the Laws of  Edward the Confessor, cap. 14. So Fealty, Homage, and Relief,  were incident to Tenures by the Laws of Normandy, Vide Contumier,  cap. 29. And so they were in England before the Conquest, as  appears by the Laws of Edward the Confessor, cap. 35. and the  Laws of Canutus, mentioned by Brompton cap. 8. So the Trial by  Jury of Twelve Men was the usual Trial among the Normans in most  Suits, especially in Assizes, & Juris Utrums, as appears by the  Contumier, cap. 92, 93, & 94. and that Trial was in Use here in  England before the Conquest, as appears in Brompton among the  Laws of King Elthred, cap. 3. which gives some Specimen of it,  viz. "Habeant placita in singulis Wapentachiis & exeant Seniores  duodecim Thani vel Praepositus cum iis & jurent quod neminem  innocentem accusare nec Noxium concelare."      3dly, Again, In some Things, tho' both the Law of Normandy  and the Law of England agreed in the Fact, and in the Manner of  Proceeding, yet there was an apparent Discrimination in their Law  from ours: As for Instance, The Husband seized in Right of the  Wife, having Issue by her, and she dying, by the Custom of  Normandy he held but only during his Widowhood, Contiumier, cap.  119. But in England, he held during his Life by the Curtesy of  England.      4thly, But in some Things, the Laws of Normandy agreed with  the Laws of England, especially as they stood in the Times of  Hen. 2 and Rich. I so that they seem to be as it were Copies or  Counterparts one of another; tho' in many Things, the Laws of  England are since changed in a great Measure from what they then  were? For Instance, at this Day in England, and for very many  Ages past, all Lands of Inheritance, as well Socage Tenures, as  of Knights Service, descend to the eldest Son, unless in Kent and  some other Places where the Custom directs the Descent to all the  Males, and in some places to the youngest; but the ancient Law  used in England, though it directed Knights Services and  Serjeanties to descend to the eldest Son, yet it directed  Vassalagies and Soccage Lands to descend to all the Sons,  Glanvil. Lib. 7. cap. 3. and so does the Laws of Normandy to this  Day. Vide Contumier, cap. 26. & post hic, cap. 11.      Again. Leprosy at this Day does not impede the Descent; but  by the Laws in Use in England, in the elder Times, unto the Time  of King John, and for some Time afterwards, Leprosy did impede  the Descent, as Placito Quarto Johannis, in the Case of W. Fulch,  a Judge of that Time, and accordingly were the Laws of Normandy.  Vide Le Contumier, cap. 27.      Again. At this Day, by the Law of England, in Cases of Trials  by Twelve Men, all ought to agree, and any one dissenting, no  Verdict can be given; but by the Laws of Normandy, tho' a Verdict  ought to be by the concurring Consent of Twelve Men, yet in Case  of Dissent or Disagreement of the Jury, they used to put off the  lesser Number that were Dissenters, and added a kind of Tales  equal to the greater Number so agreeing, until they had got a  Verdict of Twelve Men that concurred, Contumier, c. 95. And we  may find some ancient Footsteps of the like Use here in England,  tho' long since antiquated, Vide Bracton, Lib. 4. cap. 19. where  he speaks thus,        Contingit etiam multotiens quod Juratores in veritate dicenda  sunt sibi contrarii ita quod in unam concordare non possunt  sententiam, Quo casu de Consilio Curiae affortietur Assisa, ita  quod apponantur alii juxta numerum majoris partis quae  dissenserit, vel saltem quatuor vel sex & adjungantur aliis, vel  etiam per seipsos sine aliis, de veritate discutiant & judicent,  & per se respondeant & eorum veredictum allocabitur & tenebitur  cum quibus ipsi convenirent.        Again. At this Day, by the Laws of England, a Man may give  his Lands in Fee-simple, which he has by Descent, to any one of  his Children, and disinherit the rest: But by the ancient Laws  used here, it seems to be otherwise; as Mich. 10. Johannis Glanv.  Lib. 7. cap. 2. the Case of William de Causeia. And accordingly  were the Laws of Normandy, as we find in the Grand Contumier,  cap. 36. "Quand le Pere avoit plusieurs fills, ils ne peut fairde  de son Heritage le un Meillenr que le auter"; and yet it seems to  this Day, in England, it holds some Resemblance in Cases of  Frank-Marriage, viz. That the Doness, in Case she will have any  Part of her Father's other Lands, ought to put her Lands in  Hochpot.      Again, By the Law of England, the younger Brother shall not  exclude the Son of the elder, who died in the Life-time of the  Father: And this was the ancient Law of Normandy, but received  some Interruption in Favour of King John's Claim, Vide Contumier.  cap. 25. & hic ante; and indeed, generally the Rule of Descents  in Normandy was the same in most Cases with that of Descents with  us at this Day; as for Instance, That the Descent of the Line of  the Father shall not resort to that of the Mother, Et e converso;  and that the Course was otherwise in Cases of Purchases. But in  most Things the Law of Normandy was consonant to the Law with us,  as it was in the Time of King Richard I and King John; except in  Cases of Descents to Bastard eigne, excluding Mulier Puisne, as  aforesaid.      Again, at this Day there are many Writs now in Use which were  anciently also in Use here, as well as in Normandy: As Writs of  Rights, Writs of Dower, Writs De novel Desseisin, de  Mortdancestor, Juris utrum, Darrein presentment, &c. And some  that are now out of Use, though anciently in Use here in England;  as Writs De Feodo vel Vado, De Feodo vel Warda, &c. All which are  taken notice of by Glanville, Lib. 13. cap. 28, 29. And the very  same Forms of Writs in Effect were in Use in Normandy, as appears  by the Contumier Per Totum, and the Writ De Feodo vel Vado,  (ibid. cap. 11.) according to Glanville, Lib. 13. cap. 27. runs  thus, viz.        Rex Vicecomiti salutem: Summone per bonos summonitores  duodenim liberos & legales homines de vicineto quod sint coram me  vel Justiciis meis eo die parati Sacramento Recognoscere utrum N.  teneat unam Carucatem Terrae in illa villa quae R. clamat versus  eum per Breve meum in Feodo an in vadio, invadiatem ei ab ipso R.  vel ab H. antecessore ejus, (vel aliter si sit Feodam vel  haereditas ipsius N. an in vadio invadiata ei ab ipso R. vel ab  H. &c. Et interim terram illam videant, &c. (Vide ibid.)        And according to the Grand Contumier, that Writ runs thus,  viz.        Si Rex fecerit te securum de clamore suo prosequend'  summoneas Recognitores de Viceneto quod sint ad primas Assisas  Ballivae, ad cognoscendum utrum Carucata Terrae in B. quod. G.  deforceat R. sit Feodum tenentis vel vadium novum dictum per  manus G. post Coronationem Regis Richardi & pro quanta, & utrum  sit propinquior Haeres ad redimendum vadium, & videatur interum  Terrae, &c.        So that there seems little Variance, either in the Nature or  in the Form of those Writs used here in the Time of Henry 2. And  those used in Normandy when the Contumier was made.      Again, The Use was in England, to limit certain notable  Times, within the Compass of which those Titles which Men  design'd to be relieved upon, must accrue: Thus it was done in  the Time of Henry 3 by the Statute of Merton, cap. 8. at which  Time the Limitation in a Writ of Right was from the Time of King  Henry I and by that Statute it is reduced to the Time of King  Henry 2 and for Assizes of Mortdancestor they were thereby  reduced from the last Return of King John out of Ireland, which  was 12 Johannis, and for Assizes of Novel Disseisin, a Prima  Transfretatione Regis in Normanniam, which was 5 Hen. 3 and which  before that had been Post ultimum redditum Henricus 3 de  Britannia, as appears by Bracton. And this Time of Limitation was  also afterwards, by the Statutes of Westm. I. cap. 39. and West.  2. cap. 2. 46. reduced unto a narrow Scantlet, the Writ of Right  being limited to the First Coronation of King Richard I.      But before the Limitation set by that Statute of Merton,  there were several Limitations set for severals Writs; for we  find among the Pleas of King John's Time, the Limitation of  Writs, De Tempore quo Rex Henricus avus noster fuit vivus &  Mortuus; and in a Writ of Aile, Die quo Rex Henricus obiit in the  Time of Henry 2. as appears by Glanville, Lib. 13. cap. 3. there  were then divers Limitations in Use, as in Moridancestors, Post  Prima Coronationem nostram, viz. Henrici secundi, Glanvil. Lib.  I. cap. I and touching Assizes of Novel Disseisin, Vide ibid.  cap. 32. where he tells us, Cium quis intra Assisam, &c. And the  Time of Limitation in an Assize, was then post ultimdm meam  Transfretationem, (viz. Henrici Primi) in Normanniam, Lib. 13.  cap. 33. But in a Writ of Right, as also in a Writ of Customs and  Services, it was de Tempore Regis Henrici avi mei, viz. Hen. I.  vid. ib. Lib. 12. cap. 10, 16. and it seems very apparent, that  the Limitations anciently in Normandy, for all Actions Ancestral  was Post Primam Coronaiionem Regis Henrici fecundi, as appears  expresly in the Contumier, cap. 111. De Feofe & Gage.      So that anciently the Time of Limitation in Normandy was the  same as in England, and indeed borrowed from England, viz. In all  Actions Ancestrel from the Coronation of Henry 2. And thus in  those Actions wherein the Limitation was anciently from the  Coronation of King Richard I was substituted as in the Writ De  Feofe & Gage, in the Contumier, cap. 111. De Feofe & Forme, cap.  112. In the Writ De Ley Apparisan, ib. cap. 24. & cap. 22. "Ascun  Gage ne peut estre requise en Normandy, si il ne suit engage post  le Coronement de Roy Richard ou deins quarante annus": So that  the old Limitation, as well for the Redemption of Mortgages, as  for bringing those Writs above-mentioned, was post Coronationem  Regis Henrici Secundi; but altered, as it seems, by King Philip,  the Son of Lewis King of France, after King John's Ejectment out  of Normandy, and since the Time from the Coronation of King  Richard I is estimated to bear Proportion to 40 years. It is  probable this Change of the Limitation by King Philip of France,  was about the Beginning of the Reign of King Henry 3 or about 30  or 40 years after the Coronation of Richard I from whose  Coronation about 30 years were elapsed, 5 aut. 6 Henrici 3 for  anciently the Limitation in this Case was 30 years.      Fourthly, I now come to the Fourth Inquiry, viz. How this  great Parity between the Laws of England and Normandy came to be  effected; and before I come to it, I shall premise Two  Observables, which I would have the Reader to carry along with  him through the whole Discourse, viz. First, That this Parity of  Laws does not at all infer a Necessity, that they should be  imposed by the Conqueror, which is sufficiently shewn in the  foregoing Chapters; and in this it will appear that there were  divers other Means that caused a Similitude of both Laws, without  any Supposition of imposing them by the Conqueror. Secondly, That  the Laws of Normandy were in the greater Part thereof borrowed  from ours, rather than ours from them, and the Similitude of the  Laws of both Countries did in greater Measure arise from their  Imitation of our Laws, rather than from our Imitation of theirs,  though there can't be denied a Reciprocal Imitation of each  others Laws was, in some Measure at least, had in both Dominions:  And these Two Things being premised, I descend to the Means  whereby this Parity or Similitude of the Laws of both Countries  did arise, as follow, viz.        First, Mr Camden and some others have thought, there was ever  some Congruity between the ancient Customs of this Island and  those of the Country of France, both in Matters Religious and  Civil; and tells us of the ancient Druids, who were the common  Instructors of both Countries. Gallia Causidicos docuit facunda  Britannos: And some have thought, that anciently both Countries  were conjoined by a small Neck of Land, which might make an  easier Transition of the Customs of either Country to the other;  but those Things are too remote Conjectures, and we need them not  to solve the Congruity of Laws between England and Normandy.  Therefore,      Secondly, It seems plain, that before the Normans coming in  Way of Hostility, there was a great Intercourse of Commerce and  Trade, and a mutual Communication, between those Two Countries;  and the Consanguinity between the Two Princes gave Opportunities  of several Interviews between them and their Courts in each  others Countries: And it is evident by History, that the  Confessor, before his Accession to the Crown, made a long Stay in  Normandy, and was there often, which of Consequence must draw  many of the English thither, and of the Normans hither; all which  sight be a Means of their mutual Understanding of the Customs and  Laws of each others Country, and gave Opportunities of  Incorporating and ingrafting divers of them into each other, as  they were found useful or convenient; and therefore the Author of  the Prologue to the Grand Custumier thinks it more probable, That  the Laws of Normandy were derived from England, than that ours  were derived from thence.      Thirdly, 'Tis evident, that when the Duke of Normandy came  in, he brought over a great Multitude, not only of ordinary  Soldiers, but of the best of the Nobility and Gentry of Normandy;  hither they brought their Families, Language and Customs, and the  Victor used all Art and Industry to incorporate them into this  Kingdom: And the more effectually to make both People become one  Nation, he made Marriages between the English and Normans,  transplanting many Norman Families hither, and many English  Families thither; he kept his Court sometimes here, and sometimes  there; and by those Means insensibly derived many Norman Customs  hither, and English Customs thither, without any severe  Imposition of Laws on the English as Conqueror: And by this  Method he might easily prevail to bring in, even without the  Peoples Consent, some Customs and Laws that perhaps were of  Foreign Growth; which might the more easily be done, considering  how in a short Time the People of both Nations were intermingled;  they were singled in Marriages, in Families, in the Church, in  the State, in the Court, and in Councils; yea, and in Parliaments  in both Dominions, though Normandy became, as it were, an  Appendix to England, which was the nobler Dominion, and received  a greater Conformity of their Laws to the English, than they gave  to it.      Fourthly, But the greatest Means of the Assimilation of the  Laws of both Kingdoms was this: The Kings of England continued  Dukes of Normandy till King John's Time, and he kept some Footing  there notwithstanding the Confiscation thereof by the King of  France, as aforesaid; and during all this Time, England, which  was an absolute Monarch, had the Prelation or Preference before  Normandy, which was but a Feudal Dutchy, and a small Thing in  respect of England; and by this Means Normandy became, as it  were, an Appendant to England, and successively received its Laws  and Government from England; which had a greater Influence on  Normandy than that could have on England; insomuch that  oftentimes there issued Precepts into Normandy to summon Persons  there to answer in Civil Causes here; yea, even for Lands and  Possessions in Normandy; as Placito 1 Johannis, a Precept issued  to the Seneschal of Norsandy, to summon Robert Jeronymus, to  answer to John Marshal, in a Plea of Land, giving him 40 Days  Warning; to which the Tenant appeared, and pleaded a Recovery in  Normandy: And the like Precept issued for William de Bosco,  against Jeoffry Rusham, for Lands in Corbespine in Normandy.      And on the other Side, Trin. 14 Johannis, in a Suit between  Francis Borne and Thomas Adorne, for certain Lands in Ford. The  Defendant pleaded a Concord made in Normandy in the Time of King  Richard I upon a Suit there before the King, for the Honour of  Bonn in Normandy, and for certain Lands in England, whereof the  Lands in Question were Parcel, before the Seneschal of Normandy,  Anno 1099. But it was excepted against, as an insufficient Fine,  and varying in Form from other Fines; and therefore the Defendant  relied upon it as a Release.        By these, and many the like Instances, it appears as follows,  viz.      First, That there was a great Intercourse between England and  Normandy before and after the Conqueror, which might give a great  Opportunity of an Assimilation and Conformity of the Laws in both  Countries. Secondly, That a much greater Conformation of Laws  arose after the Conqueror, during the Time that Normandy was  enjoyed by the Crown of England, than before. And Thirdly, That  this Similitude of the Laws of England and Normandy was not by  Conformation of the Laws of England to those of Normandy, but by  Conformation of the Laws of Normandy to those of England, which  now grew to a great Height, Perfection and Glory; so that  Normandy became but a Perquisite or Appendant of it.      And as the Reason of the Thing speaks it, so the very Fact  itself attests it. For        First, It is apparent, That in Point of Limitation in Actions  Ancestral, from the Time of the Coronation of King Henry 2 it was  anciently so here in England in Glanville's Time, and was  transmitted from hence into Normandy; for it is no way reasonable  to suppose the contrary, since Glanville mentions it to be  enacted here, Concilio procerum; and though this be but a single  Point, or Instance, yet the Evidence thereof makes out a  Criterion, or probable Indication, that many other Laws were in  like Manner so sent hence into Normandy.      Secondly, It appears, That in the Succession of the Kings of  England, from King William I to King Henry 2 the Laws of England  received a great Improvement and Perfection, as will plainly  appear from Glanville's Book, written in the Time of King Henry 2  especially if compared with those Sums or Collections of Laws,  either of Edward the Confessor, William I or Henry I whereof  hereafter.      So that it seems, by Use, Practice, Commerce, Study and  Improvement of the English People, they arrived in Henry 2d's  Time to a greater Improvement of the Laws; and that in the Time  of King Richard I and King John, they were more perfected, as may  be seen in the Pleadings, especially of King John's Time: And  tho' far inferior to those of the Times of Succeeding Kings, yet  they are far more regular and perfect than those that went before  them. And now if any do but compare the Contumier of Normandy,  with the Tract of Glanville, he will plainly find that the Norman  Tract of Laws followed the Pattern of Glanville, and was writ  long after it, when possibly the English Laws were yet more  refined and more perfect; for it is plain beyond Contradiction,  that the Collection of the Customs and Laws of Normandy was made  after the Time of King Henry 2, for it mentions his Coronation,  and appoints it for the Limitation of Actions Ancestrel, which  must at least be 30 years after; nay, the Contumier appears to  have been made after the Act of Settlement of Normandy in the  Crown of France; for therein is specified the Institution of  Philip King of France, for appointing the Coronation of King  Richard I for the Limitation of Actions which was after the said  Philip's full Possession of Normandy.      Indeed, if those Laws and Customs of Normandy had been a  Collection of the Laws they had had there before the coming in of  King William I, it might have been a Probability that their Laws,  being so near like ours, might have been transplanted from thence  hither; but the Case is visibly otherwise, for the Contumier is a  Collection after the Time of King Richard I, yea, after the Time  of King John, and possibly after Henry 3d's Time, when it had  received several Repairings, Amendments and Polishings, under the  several Kings of England, William I, William 2, Henry I, King  Steven, Henry 2, Richard I, and King John; who were either  knowing themselves in the Laws of England, or were assisted with  a Council that were knowing therein.      And as in this Tract of Time the Laws of England received a  great Advance and Perfection, as appears by that excellent  Collection of Glanville, written even in Henry 2's Time, when yet  there were near 30 years to acquire unto a further Improvement  before Normandy was lost; so from the Laws of England thus  modelled, polished and perfected, the same Draughts were drawn  upon the Laws of Normandy, which received the fairest Lines from  the Laws of England, as they stood at least in the Beginning of  King John's Time, and were in Effect in a great Measure the  Defloration of the English Laws, and a Transcript of them, though  mingled and interlarded with many particular Laws and Customs of  their own, which altered the Features of the Original in many  Points.      VII. Concerning the Progress of the Laws of England after the  Time of King William I, until the Time of King Edward 2        That which precedes in the Two foregoing Chapters, gives us  some Account of the Laws of England, as they stood in and after  the great Change which happened under King William I commonly  called The Conqueror. I shall now proceed to the History thereof  in the ensuing Times, until the Reign of King Edward 2.      William I having Three Sons; Robert the eldest, William the  next, and Henry the youngest, disposed of the Crown of England to  William his second Son, and the Dutchy of Normandy to Robert his  eldest Son; and accordingly William 2 commonly called, William  Rufus, succeeded his Father in this Kingdom. We have little  memorable of him in relation to the Laws, only that he severely  press'd and extended the Forest Laws.      Henry I, Son of William I and Brother of William 2 succeeded  his said Brother in the Kingdom of England, and afterwards  expelled his eldest Brother Robert out of the Dutchy of Normandy  also. He proceeded much in the Benefit of the Laws, viz.      First, He restored the Free-Election of Bishops and Abbots,  which before that Time he and his Predecessors invested, Per  Anniulum & Bacculum; yet reserving those Three Ensigns of the  Patronage thereof, viz. Conge d'Eslire, Custody of the  Temporalties, and Homage upon their Restitution. Vide Hoveden, in  Vita sua.      But Secondly, The great Essay he made, was the composing an  Abstract or Manual of Laws, wherein he confirm'd the Laws of  Edward the Confessor, Cum illis Emendationibus quibus eam Pater  meus emendavit Baronum suorum Concilio; and then adds his own  Laws, some whereof seem to taste of the Canon Law. The whole  Collection is transcribed in the Red Book of the Exchequer; from  whence it is now printed in the End of Lambard's Saxon Laws; and  therefore not needfull to be here repeated.      They, for the most Part, contain a Model of Proceedings in  the County Courts, the Hundred Courts, and the Courts Leet; the  former to be held Twelve Times in the Year, the latter twice; and  also of the Courts Baron. These were the ordinary usual Courts,  wherein Justice was then, and for a long Time after, most  commonly administred; also they concern Criminal Proceedings, and  the Punishment of Crimes, and some few Things touching Civil  Actions and Interests, as in Chapter 70, directing Descents, viz.        Si quis sine Liberis decesserit Pater aut Mater ejus in  Hereditatem succedant, vel Frater vel Soror, si Pater & Mater  desint; si nec hos habeat, Frater vel Soror Patris vel Matris, &  deinceps in quintum Genetalium, qui cum propiores in parentela  sint hereditario Jure succedant; Et dum virilis sexus extiterit &  haereditas ab inde sit Femina non haereditetur; primum Patris  Feodum primogenitus Filius habeat. Emptiones vero & deinceps  Acquisitiones det cui magis velit, sed si Bockland habeat quam ei  Parentes dederint, Mittat eam extra cognationem suam.        I have observ'd and inserted this Law, for Two Reasons, viz.  First, To justify what I before said, That the Laws of Normandy  took the English Laws for their Pattern in many Things; Vide le  Contumier, cap. 25, 26, 36, &c. And Secondly, To see how much the  Laws of England grew and increased in their Particularity and  Application between this Time and the Laws of William I which in  Chapter 36, has no more touching Descents but this, viz. Si quis  intestatus obierit, liberi ejus haereditatem equsliter dividant.  But Process of Time grafted thereupon, and made particular  Provisions for particular Cases, and added Distributions and  Subdivisions to those General Rules.      These Laws of King Henry I are a kind of Miscellany, made up  of those ancient Laws, called, The Laws of the Confessor, and  King William I and of certain Parts of the Canon and Civil Law,  and of other Provisions, that Custom and the Prudence of the King  and Council had thought upon, chosen, and put together.      King Stephen succeeded, by Way of Usurpation, upon Maud the  sole Daughter and Heir of King Hen. I. The Laws of Hen. I grew  tedious and ungrateful to the People, partly because new, and so  not so well known, and partly because more difficult and severe  than those ancient Laws, called, The Confessor's; for Walsingham,  in his Ypodigma Neustriae, tells us, That the Londoners  petitioned Queen Maud, ut liceret eis uti Legibus sancti Edvardi  & non legibus Patris sui Henrici, quia graives erant,. and that  her Refusal gave Occasion to their Defection from her, and  strengthened Stephen in his Usurpation; who according to the  Method of Usurpers, to secure himself in the Throne, was willing  and ready to gratify the Desires of the People herein; and  furthermore, took his Oath, 1st, That he would not retain in his  Hands the Temporalties of the Bishops: 2dly, That he would remit  the Severity of the Forest Laws; and 3dly, That he would also  remit the Tribute of Danegelt: But he performed nothing.      His Times were troublesome, he did little in relation to the  Laws; nor have we any Memorial of any Record touching his  Proceedings therein, only there are some few Pipe Rolls of his  Time, relating to the Revenue of the Crown.      Henry 2, the Son of Maud, succeeded Stephen, he reigned long,  viz. about Thirty Five Years; and tho' he was not without great  Troubles and Difficulties, yet he built up the Laws and the  Dignity of the Kingdom to a great Height and Perfection. For,      First, In the Entrance of his Government he settled the Peace  of the Kingdom; he also reformed the Coin, which was much  adulterated and debased in the Times and Troubles of King  Stephen, Et Leges Henrici avi sui praecepit per totum Regnum  inviolabiliter observari. Hoveden.      Secondly, Against the Insolencies and Usurpations of the  Clergy. he by the Advice of his Council or Parliament at  Clarendon, enacted those Sixteen Articles mentioned by Mat.  Paris, sub Anno 1164. They are long, and therefore I remit you  thither for the Particulars of them.      'Tis true, Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, boldly  and insolently took upon him to declare many of those Articles  void, especially those Five mentioned in his Epistle to  Suffragans, recorded by Hoveden, viz. 1st, That there should be  no Appeal to the Bishop without the King's Licence. 2dly, That no  Archbishop or Bishop should go over the Seas at the Pope's  Command without the King's Licence. 3dly, That the Bishop should  not excommunicate the King's Tenants in Capite without the King's  Licence. 4thly, That the Bishop should not have the Conuzance of  Perjury, or Fidei Laesionis. And, 5thly, That the Clergy should  be convened before Lay Judges, and that the King's Courts should  have Conuzance of Churches and of Tythes.      Thirdly, He raised up the Municipal Laws of the Kingdom to a  greater Perfection, and a more orderly and regular Administration  than before; 'tis true, we have no Record of judicial Proceedings  so ancient as that Time, except the Pipe Rolls in the Exchequer,  which are only Accounts of his Revenue: But we need no other  Evidence hereof than the Tractate of Glanville, which tho'  perhaps it was not written by that Ranulphus de Glanvilla, who  was Justitiarius Angliae under Hen. 2, yet it seems to be wholly  written at that Time; and by that Book, tho' many Parts thereof  are at this Day antiquated and altered, and in that long Course  of Time, which has elapsed since that King's Reign, much  enlarged, reformed, and amended; yet by comparing it with those  Laws of the Confessor and Conqueror, yea, and the Laws of his  Grandfather King Hen. I which he confirmed; it will easily  appear, that the Rule and Order, as well as the Administration of  the Law, was greatly improved beyond what it was formerly, and we  have more Footsteps of their Agreement and Concord herein with  the Laws, as they were used from the Time of Edw. I and  downwards, than can be found in all those obsolete Laws of Hen. I  which indeed were but disorderly, confused and general Things,  rather the Cases and Shells of directing the Way of  Administration than Institutions of Law, if compared with  Glanville's Tractate of our Laws.      Fourthly, The Administration of the Common Justice of the  Kingdom, seems to be wholly dispensed in the County Courts,  Hundred Courts, and Courts Baron, except some of the greater  Crimes reformed by the Laws of King Hen. I and that Part thereof  which was sometimes taken up by the Justitiarius Anglicae: This  doubtless bred great Inconvenience, Uncertainty, and Variety in  the Laws, viz.      First, by the Ignorance of the Judges, which were the  Freeholders of the County: For altho' the Alderman or Chief  Constable of every Hundred was always to be a Man learned in the  Laws; and altho' not only the Freeholders, but the Bishops,  Barons, and great Men, were by the Laws of King Hen. I appointed  to attend the County Court; yet they seldom attend there, or if  they did, in Process of Time they neglected the Study of the  English Laws, as great Men usually do.      Secondly, Another Inconvenience was, That this also bred  great Variety of Laws, especially in the several Counties: For  the Decisions or Judgments being made by divers Courts, and  several Independent Judges and Judicatories, who had no common  Interest among them in their several Judicatories, thereby in  Process of Time every several County would have several Laws,  Customs, Rules, and Forms of Proceeding, which is always the  Effect of several Independent Judicatories administred by several  Judges.      Thirdly, A Third Inconvenience was, That all the Business of  any Moment was carried by Parties and Factions: For the  Freeholders being generally the Judges, and Conversing one among  another, and being as it were the Chief Judges, not only of the  Fact, but of the Law; every Man that had a Suit there, sped  according as he could make Parties; and Men of great Power and  Interest in the County did easily overbear others in their own  Causes, or in such wherein they were interested, either by  Relation of Kindred, Tenure, Service, Dependance, or Application.      And altho' in Cases of false Judgment, the Law, even as then  used, proved a Remedy by Writ of false Judgment before the King  or his Chief Justice; and in Case the Judgment was found to be  such in the County Court, all the Suiters were considerably  amerced, (which also continued long after in Use with some  Severity) yet this proved but an ineffectual Remedy for those  Mischiefs.      Therefore the King took another and a more effectual Course;  for in the 22d Year of his Reign, by Advice of his Parliament  held at Northampton, he instituted Justices itinerant, dividing  the Kingdom into Six Circuits, and to every Circuit allotting  Three Judges, Knowing or Experienced in the Laws of the Realm:  These Justices with their several Circuits are declared by  Hoveden, sub eodem Anno, i. e. 22 H. 2. viz.        1. Hugo Cressy, Walterus filius Roberti, & Robertus Maunsel,  for Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Bedford, Buckingham,  Essex, and Hartford Counties.      2. Hugo de Gundevilla, W. filius Radulphi, & W. Basset, for  Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Stafford, W arwick, Northampton, and  Leicester Counties.      3. Robertus filius Bernardi, Richardus Giffard, & Rogerus  filius Ramfrey, for Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Berks, and  Oxon Counties.      4. W. filius Stephani, Bertein de Verdun, & Turstavi filius  Simonis, for Hereford, Gloucester, Worcester, and Salop  Countries.      5. Radulphus filius Stephani, W. Ruffus, & Gilbertus Pipard,  for the Counties of Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall.      6. Robertus deWatts, Radulphus de Glanvilla, & Robertus  Picknot, for the Counties of York, Richmond, Lancaster Copland,  Westmorland, Northumberland, and Cumberland.        Hi, (Consilio Archiepiscoporum, Episcoporum, Comitum &  Baronum Regni, &c. apud Nottingham existentium) missi sunt per  singulos Angliae Comitatus & juraverunt quod cuilibet jus suum  conservarent illae sum. Hoveden fo. 313. & Mat. Paris, in Anno  1176.        And that these Men were well known in the Law, appears by  their Companion Radulphus de Glanvilla, who seems to be the  Author of the Treatise De Legibus Angliae, and was afterwards  made Justitiarius Angliae.      To those Justices, was afterwards committed the Conuzance of  all Civil and Criminal Pleas happening within their Divisions,  and likewise Pleas of the Crown, Pleas touching Liberties, and  the King's Rights; and the better to acquaint them with their  Business, there were certain Assises which were first enacted at  Clarendon, and afterwards confirmed at Northampton; they were not  much unlike the Capitula ltineris mentioned in our old Magna  Charta, but not so perfect, and are set down by Hoveden iubi  supra, and are too long to be here inserted: I shall only take  Notice of this one, viz. Establishing Descents, because I shall  hereafter have Occasion to use it, Si quis obierit Francus Tenens  haeredes ipsius remaneant in talem Seisina qualem Pater suus, &c.      But besides those Courts in Eyre, there were two great  standing Courts, viz. The Exchequer, and the Court of  Kings-Bench, Vel Curiam coram ipso Rege, vel ejus Justiciario;  and it was provided by the above-mentioned Assisae, "Quod  Justiciae faciant omnes Justicias & Rectitudines Spectantes ad  Dominium Regis, & ad Coronam suam, per breve Domini Regis vel  illorum qui in ejus Loco erunt de Feodo dimidii Militis & infra,  Nisi tam grandis sit quaerela quod non possit deduci sine Domino  Rege vel talis quam Justiciae ei reponunt pro dubitatione sua,  vel ad illos qui in Loco ejus erunt," &c.      Neither do I find any distinct Mention of the Court of Common  Bench in the Time of this King, tho' in the Time of King John  there is often mention made thereof, and the Rolls of that Court  of King John's Time are yet extant upon Record, & vide post. sub  Richardi Primi.      The Limitation of the Assise of Novel Disseisin, is by those  Assises appointed to be, a tempore quo Dominus Rex venit in  Angliam proximam post Pacis factam inter ipsum, & Regem filium  suum.      The same King afterwards, in the Twenty fifth Year of his  Reign, divided the Limits of his Itinerant Justices into Four  Circuits or Divisions, and to each Circuit assigned a greater  Number of Justices, viz. Five at least, which are thus set down  in Hoveden, Folio 337. viz.        Anno 1179, 25 H. 2. Magno Concilio celebrato apud  Windeshores, Communi Consilio Archiepiscoporum Comitum & Baronum  & coram Rege Filio Suo, Rex divisit Angliam in quatuor Partes, &  unicuique partium praefecit viros sapientes ad faciendum  Justitiam in Terra sua in hunc Modum.      1. Ricardus-Episcopus Winton, Ricardus Thesaurarius Regis,  Nicholaus filius Turoldi, Thomas Basset & Robertus de Whitefield,  for the Counties of Southampton, Wilts, Gloucester, Somerset,  Devon, Cornwall, Berks and Oxon.      2. Galfridus Eliensis Episcopus, Nicholaus Capellanus Regis,  Gilbertus Pipard, Reginald de Wisebeck Capellanus Reges &  Gaulfridus Hosce, for the Counties of Cambridge, Huntingdon,  Northampton, Leicester, Warwick, Winchester, Hereford, Stafford  and Salop.      3. Johannes Episcopas Norwicensis, Hugo Murdac Clericus  Regis, Michael Bellet, Richardus de le Pec, & Radulphus Brito,  for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Hartford, Middlesex, Kent, Surrey,  Sussex, Bucks and Bedford.      4. Galfredus de Luci, Johannes Comyn, Hugo de Gaerst,  Radulphus de Glanvilla, W. de Bendings, Alanus de Furnellis, for  the Counties of Nottingham, Derby, York, Northumberland,  Westmorland, Cumberland, and Lancaster.      Isti sunt Justiciae in Curia Regis constituti ad audiendum  clamores Populi.        This Prince did these Three notable Things, viz.        First, By this Means, he improved and perfected the Laws of  England, and doubtless transferred over many of the English Laws  into Normandy, which, as before is observed, caused that great  Suitableness between their Laws and ours; so that the Similitude  did arise much more by a Conformation of their Laws to those of  England, than by any Conformation of the English Laws to theirs,  especially in the Reigns of King Hen. 2 and his Two Sons, King  Richard, and King John, both of whom were also Dukes of Normandy.      Secondly, He check'd the Pride and Insolence of the Pope and  the Clergy, by those Constitutions made in a Parliament at  Clarendon, whereby he restrained the Exorbitant Power of the  Ecclesiasticks, and the Exemption they claimed from Secular  Jurisdiction. And,      Thirdly, He subdued and conquered Ireland, and added it to  the Crown of England, which Conquest was begun by Richard Earl of  Stigule or Strongbow, 14 H. 2. But was perfected by the King  himself in the Seventeenth Year of his Reign, and for the greater  Solemnity of the Business, was ratified by the Fealties of the  Bishops and Nobles of Ireland, and by a Bull of Confirmation from  Pope Alexander, who was willing to interest himself in that  Business, to ingratiate himself with the King, and to gain a  Pretence for that arrogant Usurpation of disposing of Temporal  Dominions, Vide Hoveden, Anno 14 H. 2.      Richard I eldest Son of King Henry 2 succeeded his Father. I  have seen little of Record touching the Juridicial Proceedings,  either of him, or his said Father, other than what occurs in the  Pipe-Rolls in the Exchequer, which both in the Time of Hen. 2,  Rich. I, and King John, and all the succeeding Kings, are fairly  preserved; and the best Remembrances that we have of this King's  Reign in relation to the Law, are what Roger Hoveden's Annals  have delivered down to us, viz.      First, He instituted a Body of Naval Laws in his Return from  the Holy Land, in the Island of Oleron, which are yet extant with  some Additions; De quibus, Vide Mr Selden's Mare Clausum, Lib. 2.  cap. 24. and I suppose they are the same which are attributed to  him by Mat. Paris, Anno 1196. and he constituted Justices to put  them in Execution.      Secondly, He observed the same Method of distributing Justice  as his Father had begun, by Justices Itinerant per singulos  Angliae Comitatus, to whom he deliver two Kinds of Extracts or  Articles of Inquiry, viz. Capitula Coronae, much reformed and  augmented from what they were before, and Capitula de Judaeis;  the whole may be read in Hoveden, fo. 423. sub Anno 5 R. I. and  by those Articles it appears, That at that Time there was a  settled Court for the Common-Pleas, as well as for the King's  Bench, tho' it seems that Pleas of Land were then indifferently  held in either, as appears by the first and second Articles  thereof, where we have, Placita Per breve Domini Regis, vel Per  breve Capitalis Justiciae, vel a Capitali Curia Regis coram eis  (Justiciis) missa: The former whereof seems to be the  Common-Pleas, which held Pleas by Original Writ, which Writ was  under the King's Teste when he was in England; but when he was  beyond the Seas, it was under the Teste of the Justiciarius  Angliae, as the Custos Regni in the King's Absence.      The Power which the Justices Itinerant had to hold Pleas in  Writs of Right, or the Grand Assize, was sometimes limited, as  here by the Articuli Coronae under Hen. 2. to half a Knight's  Fee, or under: For here in these Articles it is, De Magnis  Assisis quae sunt de centum Solidis & infra. But in the next  Commissions, or Capitula Coronae, it is, De Magnis Assisis usque  ad decem Libratas Terre & infra.      In his eighth Year, he established a Common Rule for Weights  and Measures throughout England, called Assisa de Mensuris,  wherein we find the Measure of Woollen Cloths was then the same  with that of Magna Charta, 9 H. 3. viz. De diuobus ulnis infra  Lisuras.      In the Year before his Death, the like Justices Errant went  through many Counties of England, to whom Articles, or Capitiuls  Placitorium Coronae, not much unlike the former were delivered.  Vide Hoveden, sub Anno 1198. fo. 445.      And in the same Year, he issued Commissions in the Trent,  Hugh de Neville being Chief Justice; and to those were also  delivered Articles of Inquiry, commonly called Assisae de  Foresta, which may be read at large in Hoveden, sub eodem Anno.  These gave great Discontent to the Kingdom, for both the Laws of  the Forest, and their Execution were rigorous and grievous.      King John succeeded his said Brother, both in the Kingdom of  England, and Dutchy of Normandy; the Evidence that we have,  touching the Progress of the Laws of his Time, are principally  Three, viz. First. His Charters of Liberties. 2dly, The Records  of Pleadings and Proceedings in his Courts; And 3dly, The Course  he took for settling the English Laws in Ireland.      1. Touching the first of these, his Charters of the Liberties  of England, and of the Forest, were hardly, and with Difficulty,  gained by his Baronage at Stanes, Anno Dom. 1215. The Collection  of the former was, as Mat. Paris tells us, upon the View of the  Charter or Law of King Hen. I. which says, he contained "quasdam  Libertates & Leges a Rege Edvardo Sancto, Ecclesiae & Magnatibus  concessas, exceptis quibusdam Libertatibus quas idem Rex de suo  adjecit"; and that thereupon the Baronage fell into a Resolution  to have those Laws granted by King John. But as it is certain,  that the Laws added by King Hen. I to those of the Confessor were  many more, and much differing from his; so the Laws contained in  the Great Charter of King John, differed much from those of King  Hen. I. Neither are we to think, that the Charter of King John  contained all the Laws of England, but only or principally such  as were of a more comprehensive Nature, and concerned the Common  Rights and Liberties of the Church, Baronage and Commonalty which  were of the greatest Moment, and had been most invaded by King  John's Father and Brother.      The lesser Charter, or De Foresta, was to reform the Excesses  and Encroachments which were made, especially in the Time of  Rich. I and Hen. 2 who had made New Afforestations, and much  extended the Rigour of the Forest Laws: And both these Charters  do in Substance agree with that Magna Charta, & de Foresta,  granted and confirm'd 9 Hen. 3. I shall not need to recite them,  or to make any Collections or Inferences from them; they are both  extant in the Red Book of the Exchequer, and in Mat. Paris, sub  Anno 1215, and the Record and the Historian do Verbatim agree.      As to the Second Evidence we have of the Progress of the Laws  in King John's Time, they are the Records of Pleadings and  Proceedings which are still extant: But altho' this King  endeavoured to bring the Law, and the Pleadings and Proceedings  thereof, to some better Order than he found it; for saving his  Profits whereof he was very studious, and for the better  Reduction of it into Order and Method, we find frequently in the  Records of his Time, Fines imposed, Pro Stultiloquio, which were  no other than Mulcts imposed by the Court for barbarous and  disorderly Pleading: From whence afterwards that Common Fine  arose, Pro Pulchre Placitando, which was indeed no other than a  Fine for want of it; and yet for all this, the Proceeding in his  Courts were rude, imperfect, and defective, to what they were in  the ensuing Times of Edw. I. &c. But some few Observables I shall  take Notice of upon the Perusal of the Judicial Records of the  Time of King John, viz.        1 st. That the Courts of King's-Bench and Common-Pleas were  then distinct Courts, and distinctly held from the Beginning to  the End of King John's Reign.      2dly, That as yet, neither one nor both of those Courts  dispatch'd the Business of the Kingdom, but a great Part thereof  was dispatch'd by the Justices Itinerant, which were sometimes in  Use, but not without their Intermissions, and much of the Publick  Business was dispatch'd in the County Courts, and in other  inferior Courts; and so it continued, tho' with a gradual  Decrease till the End of King Edw. I, and for some Time after:  And hence it was, That in those elder Times, the Profits of those  County Courts for which the Sheriff answered in his Farm, de  Proficuis Comitatus; also Fines were levied there, and post  Fines, and Fines Pro licentia concordandi, and great Fines there  answered; Fines Pro lnquisitionibus habendi, Fines for  Misdeameanors, tho' called Amerciaments, arose to great Sums, as  will appear to any who shall peruse the ancient Viscontiels.      But, as I said before, the Business of Inferior Courts grew  gradually less and less, and consequently their Profits and  Business of any Moment came to the Great Courts, where they were  dispatch'd with greater Justice and Equality. Besides, the  greater Courts observing what Partiality and Brocage was used in  the inferior Courts, gave a pretty quick Ear to Writs of false  Judgment, which was the Appeal the Law allowed from erroneous  Judgments in the County Courts; and this, by Degrees, wasted the  Credit and Business of those inferior Courts.      3dly, That the Distinction between the King's-Bench and  Common-Bench, as to the Point of Communia Placita, was not yet,  nor for some Time after, settled; and hence it is, that  frequently in the Time of King John, we shall find that Common  Pleas were held in B. R. yea, in Mich. & Hill. 13 Johannis, a  Fine is levied coram iPso Rege, between Gilbert Fitz Roger and  Helwise his Wife, Plaintiffs, and Robert Barpyard Tenant of  certain Lands in Kirby, &c.      And again, whereas there was frequently a Liberty granted  anciently by the Kings of England, and allowed, Quod non  implacitetur nisi coram Rege, I find inter Placita de diversis  Terminis secundo Johannis, That upon a Suit between Henry de  Rochala, and the Abbot of Leicester before the Justices de Banco,  the Abbot pleaded the Charter of King Richard I. Quod idem Abbas  pro nullo respondeat nisi coram ipso Rege vel Capitali  Justitiario suo; and it is ruled against the Abbot, Quia omnia  Placita quae coram Justic. de Banco tenentur, coram Domino Regi  vel ejus Capitali Justitiario teneri intelliguntur. But this  Point was afterwards settled by the Statute of Magna Charta, Quod  Communia Placita non sequantur Curiam nostram.      4thly. That the four Terms were then held according as was  used in After-times with little Variance, and had the same  Denominations they still retain.      5thly. That there were oftentimes considerable Sums of Money,  or Horses, or other Things given to obtain Justice; sometimes  'tis said to be, Pro habenda Inquisitione ut supra, and inter  Placita incertitemporis Regis Johannis. The Men of Yarmouth  against the Men of Hastings and Winchelsea, Afferunt Domino Regi  tres Palsridos, & sex Asturias Narenses ad Inquisitionem habendam  Per Legales, &c. and frequently the same was done, and often  accounted for in the Pipe-Rolls, under the Name of Oblata; and to  remedy this Abuse, was the Provision made in King John's and King  Hen. 3d's Charters, Nulli Vendemus Justitiam ivel Rectum. But yet  Fines upon Originals being certain, having continued to this Day,  notwithstanding that Provision; but those enormous Oblata before  mentioned, are thereby remedied and taken away.      6thly, That in all the Time of King John, the Purgation Per  Ignem & Aquam, or the Trial by Ordeal, continued as appears by  frequent Entries upon the Rolls; but it seems to have ended with  this King, for I do not find it in Use in any Time after:  Perchance the Barbarousness of the Trial, and Persuasions of the  Clergy, prevailed at length to antiquate it, for many Canons had  been made against it.      7thly, In this King's Time, the Descent of Socage as well as  Knight's Service Lands to the eldest Son prevailed in all Places,  unless there was a special Custom, that the Lands were partible  inter Masculos;. and therefore, Mich. secundo Johannis, in a  rationabili Parte Bonorum, by Gilbert Beville against William  Beville his elder Brother for Lands in Gunthorpe, the Defendant  pleaded, Quod Nunquam Parita Vel Partibilia fuere; and because  the Defendant could not prove it, Judgment was given for the  Demandant: And by Degrees it prevail'd so, that whereas at this  Time the Averment came on the Part of the Heir at Law, that the  Land nunquam Parita Vel Partibilis extetit; in a little Time  after the Averment was turn'd on the other Hand, viz. That tho'  the Land was Socage, yet unless he did aver and prove that it was  Partita & Partibilis, he failed in his Demand.        Thirdly, The third Instance of the Progress of King John's  Reign, in Relation to the Common Law, was his settling the same  in Ireland, which he made his more immediate and particular  Business: But hereof we shall add a particular Chapter by itself,  when we have shewn you what Proceedings and Progress was made  therein in the Time of Edw. I. The many and great Troubles that  fell upon King John and the whole Kingdom, especially towards the  latter End of his Reign, did much hinder the good Effect of  settling the Laws of England, and consequently the Peace thereof,  which might have been bottom'd, especially upon the Great  Charter. But this Unfortunate Prince and Kingdom were so  entangled with intestine Wars, and with the Invasion of the  French, who assisted the English Barons against their King, and  by the Advantages and Usurpations that the Pope and Clergy made  by those Distempers, that all ended in a Confusion with the  King's Death.        I come therefore to the long and troublesome Reign of Hen. 3  who was about nine Years old at his Father's Death; he being born  in Festo sancti, Remigii 1207, and King John died in Festo sancti  Lucae, 1216, and the young King was crown'd the 28th of October,  being then in the tenth Year of his Age, and was under the  Tutelage of William Earl-Marshal.      The Nobility were quick and earnest, notwithstanding his  Minority, to have the Liberties and Laws of the Kingdom  confirm'd; and Preparatory thereto, in the Year 1223, Writs  issued to the several Counties to enquire, by twelve good and  lawful Knights, Que fuerunt Libertates in Anglia tempore Regni  Henrici avi sui, returnable quindena Paschae. What Success those  Inquisitions had, or what Returns were made thereof, appears not:  But in the next Year following, the young King standing in Need  of a Supply of Money from the Clergy and Laity, none would be  granted, unless the Liberties of the Kingdom were confirm'd, as  they were express'd and contain'd in the two Charters of King  John; which the King accordingly granted in his Parliament at  Westminster, and they were accordingly proclaim'd, Ita quod  Chartae utrorumque Regum in nulla inveniatur dissimiles. Mat.  Paris. Anno 1224.      In the Year 1227, The King holding his Parliament at Oxford,  and being now of full Age; by ill Advice, causes the two Charters  he had formerly granted to be cancell'd, "Hanc occasionem  praetendens, quod Chartae illae concessae fuerunt & Libertates  scriptae & signatae dum ipse erat sub Custodia, nec sui Corporis  aut sigilli aliquam potestatem habuit, unde viribus carere  debuit," &c. Which Fact occasion'd a great disturbance in the  Kingdom: And this Inconstancy in the King, was in Truth the  Foundation of all his future Troubles, and yet was ineffectual to  his End and Purpose; for those Charters were not avoidable for  the King's Nonage, and if there could have been any such  Pretence, that alone would not avoid them, for they were Laws  confirm'd in Parliament.      But the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forest, did not  expire so; for in 1253, they were again, seal'd and publish'd:  And because after the Battle of Evesham, the King had wholly  subdued the Barons, and thereby a Jealousy might grow, that he  again meant to infringe it; in the Parliament at Marlbridge, cap.  5. they are again confirm'd. And thus we have the great  Settlement of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom establish'd  in this King's Time: The Charters themselves are not every Word  the same with those of King John, but they differ very little in  Substance.      This Great Charter, and Charta de Foresta, was the great  Basis upon which this Settlement of the English Laws stood in the  Time of this King and his Son; there were also some additional  Laws of this King yet extant, which much polish' d the Common  Law, viz. The Statutes of Merton and Marlbridge, and some others.      We have likewise two other principal Monuments of the great  Advance and Perfection that the English Laws attain'd to under  this King, viz. The Tractate of Bracton, and those Records of  Plea, as well in both Benches, as before the Justices Itinerant,  the Records whereof are still extant.      Touching the former, viz. Bracton's Tractate, it yields us a  great Evidence of the Growth of the Laws between the Times of  Henry 2, and Hen. 3. If we do but compare Glanville's Book with  that of Bracton, we shall see a very great Advance of the Law in  Writings of the latter, over what they are in Glanville. It will  be needless to instance Particulars; some of the Writs and  Process do indeed in Substance agree, but the Proceedings are  much more regular and settled, as they are in Bracton, above what  they are in Glanville. The Book itself in the Beginning seems to  borrow its Method from the Civil Law; but the greatest Part of  the Substance is either of the Course of Proceedings in the Law  known to the Author, or of Resolutions and Decisions in the  Courts of King's-Bench and Common-Bench, and before Justices  Itinerant, for now the inferior Courts began to be of little Use  or Esteem.      As to the Judicial Records of the Time of this King, they  were grown to a much greater Degree of Perfection, and the  Pleadings more orderly, many of which are extant: But the great  Troubles, and the Civil Wars, that happen'd in his Time, gave a  great Interruption to the legal Proceedings of Courts; they had a  particular Commission and Judicatory for Matters happening in  Time of War, stiled, Placita de Tempore Turbationis, wherein are  many excellent Things: They were made principally about the  Battle of Evesham, and after it; and for settling of the  Differences of this Kingdom, was the Dictum, or Edictum de  Kenelworth made, which is printed in the old Magna Charta.      We have little extant of Resolutions in this King's Time, but  what are either remember'd by Bracton, or some few broken and  scatter'd Reports collected by Fitzherbet in his Abridgment.  There are also some few Sums or Constitutions relative to the  Law, which tho' possibly not Acts of Parliament, yet have  obtain'd in Use as such; as De districtione Scaccarii, Statiutum  Panis & Cervisiae Dies Communes in Banco Statutum Hiberniae,  Stat. de Scaccario, Judicium Collistrigii, and others.      We come now to the Time of Edw. I, who is well stiled our  English Justinian; for in his Time the Law, quasi Per Saltum,  obtained a very great Perfection. The Pleadings are short indeed,  but excellently good and perspicuous: And altho' for some Time  some of those Imperfections and ancient inconvenient Rules  obtain'd; as for Instance, in Point of Descents, where the middle  Brother held of the eldest, and dying without Issue, the Lands  descended to the youngest, upon that old Rule in the Time of Hen.  2. Nemo Potest esse Dominius & Haeres, mention'd in Glanville, at  least if he had once receiv'd Homage, 13 E. I. Fitz Avowry 235.  Yet the Laws did never in any one Age receive so great and sudden  an Advancement, nay, I think I may safely say, all the Ages since  his Time have not done so much in Reference to the orderly  settling and establishing of the distributive justice of this  Kingdom, as he did within a short Compass of the thirty-five  Years of his Reign, especially about the first thirteen Years  thereof.      Indeed many Penal Statutes and Provisions, in Relation to the  Peace and good Government of the Kingdom, have been since made.  But as touching the Common Administration of Justice between  Party and Party, and accommodating of the Rules, and of the  Methods and Orders of Proceding, he did the most, at least of any  King since William I and left the same as a fix'd and stable Rule  and Order of Proceeding, very little differing from that which we  now hold and practice, especially as to the Substance and  principal Contexture thereof.        It would be the Business of a Volume to set down all the  Particulars, and therefore I shall only give some short  Observations touching the same.      First, He perfectly settled the Great Charter, and Charta de  Foresta, not only by a Practice consonant to them in the  Distribution of Law and Right, but also by that solemn Act passed  25 E. I. and stiled Confirmationes Cartarum.      Secondly, He established and distributed the several  Jurisdictions of Courts within their proper Bounds. And because  this Head has several Branches, I shall subdivide the same, viz.        1. He check'd the Incroachments and insolencies of the Pope  and the Clergy, by the Statute of Carlisle.      2. He declared the Limits and Bounds of the Ecclesiastical  Jurisdiction, by the Statute of Circumspecte Agatis & Articuli  Cleri. For note, Tho' this later Statute was not publisbed till  Edw. 2, yet was compiled in the Beginning of Edw. I.      3. He established the Limits of the Court of Common Pleas,  perfectly performing the Direction of Magna Charta, Qiuod  Communia Placita non sequantur Curia nostra, in relation to B. R.  and in express Terms extending it to the Court of Exchequer by  the Statute of Articuli super Chartas, cap. 4. It is true, upon  my First reading of the Placita de Banco of Edw. I. I found very  many Appeals of Death, of Rape, and of Robbery therein; and  therefore I doubted, whether the same were not held at least by  Writ in the Common Pleas Court: But upon better Inquiry, I found  many of the Records before Justices Itinerant were enter'd or  fill'd up among the Records of the Common Pleas, which might  occasion that Mistake.      4. He establish'd the Extent of the Jurisdiction of the  Steward and Marshal. Vide Articuli super Chartas, cap. 3. And,      5. He also settled the Bounds of Inferior Courts, not only of  Counties, Hundreds, and Courts Baron, which he kept within their  proper and narrow Bounds, for the Reasons given before; and so  gradually the Common Justice of the Kingdom came to be  administred by Men knowing in the Laws, and conversant in the  great Courts of B. R. and C. B. and before Justices Itinerant;  and also by that excellent Statute of Westminster 1. cap. 35. he  kept the Courts of Great Men within their Limits, under several  Penalties, wherein ordinarily very great Incroachments and  Oppressions were exercised.        The Third general Observation I make is, He did not only  explain, but excellently enforc'd, Magna Charta, by the Statute  De Tallagio non concedendo, 34 E. I.      Fourthly, He provided against the Interruption of the Common  Justice of the Kingdom, by Mandates under the Great Seal, or  Privy Seal, by the Statute of Articuli super Chartas, cap 6.  which, notwithstanding Magna Charta, had formerly been frequent  in Use.      Fifthly, He settled the Forms, Solemnities, and Efficacies of  Fines, confining them to the Common-Pleas, and to Justices  Itinerant, and appointed the Place where they brought the Records  after their Circuits, whereby one common Repository might be kept  of Assurances of Lands; which he did by the Statute De modo  levandi Fines, 18 E. I.      Sixthly, He settled that great and orderly Method for the  Safety and Preservation of the Peace of the Kingdom, and  suppressing of Robberies, by the Statute of Winton.      Seventhly, He settled the Method of Tenures, to prevent  Multiplicity of Penalties, which grew to a great Inconvenience,  and remedied it by the Statute of Quia Emptores Terrarum, 18 E.  I.      Eighthly, He settled a speedier Way for Recovery of Debts,  not only for Merchants and Tradesmen, by the Statutes of Acton,  Burnel, & de Mercatoribus, but also for other Persons, by  granting an Execution for a Moiety of the Lands by Elegit.      Ninthly, He made effectual Provision for Recovery of  Advowsons and Presentations to Churches, which was before  infinitely lame and defective, by Statute Westminster 2. cap. I.      Tenthly, He made that great Alteration in Estates from what  they were formerly, by Statute Westminster 2. cap. 1. whereby  Estates of Fee-Simple, conditional at Common Law, were turn'd  into Estates-Tail, not removable from the Issue by the ordinary  Methods of Alienation; and upon this Statute, and for the  Qualifications hereof, are the Superstructures built of 4 H. 7.  cap. 32, 32 H. 8. and 33 H. 8.      Eleventhly, He introduced quite a new Method, both in the  Laws of Wales, and in the Method of their Dispensation, by the  Statute of Rutland.      Twelfthly, In brief, partly by the Learning and Experience of  his Judges, and partly by his own wise Interposition, he silently  and without Noise abrogated many ill and inconvenient Usages,  both in his Courts of Justice, and in the Country. He rectified  and set in Order the Method of collecting his Revenue in the  Exchequer, and removed obsolete and illeviable Parts thereof out  of Charge; and by the Statutes of Westminster 1. and Westminster  2. Gloucester and Westminster 3. and of Articuli super Chartas,  he did remove almost all that was either grievous or impractical  out of the Law, and the Course of its Administration, and  substituted such apt, short, pithy, and effectual Remedies and  Provisions, as by the Length of Time, and Experience had of their  Convenience, have stood ever since without any great Alteration,  and are now as it were incorporated into, and become a Part of  the Common Law itself.        Upon the whole Matter, it appears, That the very Scheme, Mold  and Model of the Common Law, especially in relation to the  Administration of the Common Justice between Party and Party, as  it was highly rectified and set in a much better Light and Order  by this King than his Predecessors left it to him, so in a very  great Measure it has continued the same in all succeeding Ages to  this Day; so that the Mark or Epocha we are to take for the true  Stating of the Law of England, what it is, is to be considered,  stated and estimated from what it was when this King left it.  Before his Time it was in a great Measure rude and unpolish'd, in  comparison of what it was after his Reduction thereof; and on the  other Side, as it was thus polished and ordered by him, so has it  stood hitherto without any great or considerable Alteration,  abating some few Additions and Alterations which succeeding Times  have made, which for the most part are in the subject Matter of  the Laws themselves, and not so much in the Rules, Methods, or  ways of its Administration.      As I before observed some of those many great Accessions to  the Perfection of the Law under this King, so I shall now observe  some of those Boxes or Repositories where they may be found,  which are of the following Kiuds, viz.        First, The Acts of Parliament in the Time of this King are  full of excellent Wisdom and Perspicuity, yet Brevity; but of  this, enough before is said.      Secondly, The Judicial Records in the Time of this King. I  shall not mention those of the Chancery, the Close-Patent and  Charter Rolls, which yet will very much evidence the Learning and  Judgment of that Time; but I shall mention the Rolls of Judicial  Proceedings, especially those in the King's-Bench and  Common-Pleas, and in the Eyres. I have read over many of them,  and do generally observe,      1. That they are written in an excellent Hand.      2. That the Pleading is very short, but very clear and  perspicuous, and neither loose or uncertain, nor perplexing the  Matter either with Impropriety, Obscurity, or Multiplicity of  Words: They are clearly and orderly digested, effectually  representing the Business that they intend.      3. That the Title and the Reason of the Law upon which they  proceed (which many times is expresly delivered upon the Record  itself) is perspicuous, clear and rational; so that their short  and pithy Pleadings and judgments do far better render the Sense  of the Business, and the Reasons thereof, than those long,  intricate, perplexed, and formal Pleadings, that oftentimes of  late are unnecessarily used.      Thirdly, The Reports of the Terms and Years of this King's  Time, a few broken cases whereof are in Fitzherbert's Abridgment;  but we have no successive Terms or Years thereof, but only  ancient Manuscripts perchance, not running through the whole Time  of this King, yet they are very good, but very brief: Either the  Judges then spoke less, or the Reporters were not so ready handed  as to take all they said. And hence this Brevity makes them the  more obscure. But yet in those brief Interlocutions between the  Judge and the Pleaders, and in their Definitions, there appears a  great deal of Learning and Judgment. Some of those Reports, tho'  broken, yet the best of their Kind, are in LincolnsInn Library.      Fourthly, The Tracts written or collected in the Time of this  wise and excellent Prince, which seem to be of Two Kinds, viz.  Such as were only the Tractates of private Men, and therefore had  no greater Authority than private Collections, yet contain much  of the Law then in Use, as Fleta the Mirror, Britton and  Thornton; or else, 2dly, They were Sums or Abstracts of some  particular Parts of the Law, as Novae Narrationes, Hengam Magna &  Parva, Cadit assisa Summa, De Bastardia Summa; by all which,  compared even with Bracton, there appears a Growth and a  Perfecting of the Law into a greater Regularity and Order.      And thus much shall serve for the several Periods or Growth  of the Common Law until the Time of Edw. I inclusively, wherein  having been somewhat prolix, I shall be the briefer in what  follows, especially feeling that from this Time downwards, the  Books and Reports printed give a full Account of the ensuing  Progress of the Law.      VIII. A Brief Continuation of the Progress of the Laws, from the  Time of King Edward 2 inclusive, down to these Times        Having in the former Chapter been somewhat large in  Discoursing of the Progress of the Laws, and the incidental  Additions they received in the several Reigns of King William 2,  King Hen. I, King Stephen, King Hen. 2, King Richard I, King  John, King Hen. 3 and King Edw. I. I shall now proceed to give a  brief Account of the Progress thereof in the Time of Edw. 2 and  the succeeding Reigns, down to these Times.      Edward 2 succeeding his Father, tho' he was an unfortunate  Prince, and by reason of the Troubles and Unevenness of his  Reign, the very Law itself had many Interruptions, yet it held  its Current in a great Measure according to that Frame and State  that his Father had left it in.      Besides the Records of judicial Proceedings in his Time, many  whereof are still extant, there were some other Things that  occur'd in his Reign which gave us some kind of Indication of the  State and Condition of the Law during that Reign: As,      First, The Statutes made in his Time and especially that of  17 E. 2. stiled De Prerogativa Regis, which tho' it be called a  Statute, yet for the most part is but a Sum or Collection of  certain of the King's Prerogatives that were known Law long  before; as for Instance, The King's Wardship of Lands in Capite  attracting the Wardship of Lands held of others; The King's Grant  of a Manor not carrying an Advowson Appendant unless named; The  King's Title to the Escheat of the Lands of the Normans, which  was in Use from the first Defection of Normandy under King John;  The King's Title to Wreck, Royal Fish, Treasure Trove and many  others, which were ancient Prerogatives to the Crown.      Secondly, The Reports of the Years and Terms of this King's  Reign; these are not printed in any one entire Volume, or in any  Series or Order of Time, only some broken Cases thereof in  Fitzherbert's Abridgment, and in some other Books dispersedly;  yet there are many entire Copies thereof abroad very excellently  reported, wherein are many Resolutions agreeing with those of  Edw. 1st's Time. The best Copy of these Reports that I know now  extant, is that in Lincoln's-Inn Library, which gives a fair  Specimen of the Learning of the Pleaders and Judges of that Time.      King Edw. 3, succeeded his Father; his Reign was long, and  under it the Law was improved to the greatest Height. The Judges  and Pleaders were very learned: The Pleadings are somewhat more  polished than those in the Time of Edw. I, yet they have neither  Uncertainty, Prolixity, nor Obscurity. They were plain and  skilful, and in the Rules of Law, especially in relation to Real  Actions, and Titles of Inheritance, very learned and excellently  polished, and exceeded those of the Time of Edw. I. So that at  the latter End of this King's Reign the Law seemed to be near its  Meridian.      The Reports of this King's Time run from the Beginning to the  End of his Reign, excepting some few Years between the 10th and  17th, and 30th and 33d Years of his Reign; but those Omitted  Years are extant in many Hands in old Manuscripts.      The Book of Assizes is a Collection of the Assizes that  happened in the Time of Edw. 3, being from the Beginning to the  End extracted out of the Books and Assizes of those that attended  the Assizes in the Country.      The justices Itinerant continued by intermitting Vicissitudes  till about the 4th of Edw. 3, and some till the 10th of Edw. 3.  Their Jurisdiction extended to pleas of the Crown or Criminal  Causes, Civil Suits and Pleas of Liberties, and Quo Warranto's;  the Reports thereof are not printed, but are in many Hands in  Manuscript, both of the Times of Edw. I, Edw. 2, and Edw. 3, full  of excellent Learning. Some few broken Reports of those Eyres,  especially of Cornwal, Nottingham, Northampton, and Derby, are  collected by Fitzherbert in his Abridgment.      After the 10th of Edw. 3, I do not find any Justices Errant  ad Communia Placita, but only ad Placita forestae; other Things  that concerned those Justices Itinerant were supplied and  transacted in the Common Bench for Communia Placita, in the  King's-Bench and Exchequer for Placita de Libertatibus, and  hefore Justices of Assize, Nisi Prius, Oyer and Terminer, and  Gaol Delivery for Assizes and pleas of the Crown.      And thus much for the Law in the Time of Edw. 3.        Richard 2 succeeding his Grandfather, the Dignity of the Law,  together with the Honour of the Kingdom, by reason of the  Weakness of this Prince, and the Difficulties occurring in his  Government, seem'd somewhat to decline, as may appear by  comparing the Twelve last Years of Edw. 3, commonly called  Quadragesms, with the Reports of King Richard 2, wherein appears  a visible Declination of the Learning and Depth of the judges and  Pleaders.      It is true, we have no printed continued Report of this  King's Reign; but I have seen the entire Years and Terms thereof  in a Manuscript, out of which, or some other Copy thereof, I  suppose Fitzherbert abstracted those broken Cases of this Reign  in his Abridgment.      In all those former Times, especially from the End of Edw. 3,  back to the Beginning of Edw. I, the Learning of the Common Law  consisted principally in Assizes and Real Actions; and rarely was  any Title determined in any Personal Action, unless in Cases of  Titles to Rents, or Services by Replevin; and the Reasons thereof  were principally these, viz.      First, Because these ancient Times were great Favourers of  the Possessor, and therefore if about the Time of Edw. 2, a  Disseisor had been in Possession by a Year and a Day, he was not  to be put out without a Recovery by Assize. Again, if the  Disseisor had made a Feoffment, they did not countenance an Entry  upon the Feoffee, because thereby he might lose his Warranty,  which he might save if he were Impleaded in an Assize or Writ of  Entry; and by this Means Real Actions were frequent, and also  assizes.      Secondly, They were willing to quiet Men's Possessions, and  therefore after a Recovery or Bar in an Assize or Real Action,  the Party was driven to an Action of a higher Nature.      Thirdly, Because there was then no known Action wherein a  Person could recover his Possession, other than by an Assize or a  Real Action; for till the End of Edw. 4, the Possession was not  recovered in an Ejectione firmae, but only Damages.      Fourthly, Because an Assize was a speedy and effectual Remedy  to recover a Possession, the Jury being ready Impannell'd and at  the Bar the first Day of the Return. And altho' by Disusage, the  Practisers of Law are not so ready in it, yet the Course thereof  in those Times was as ready and as well known to all Professors  of the Law as the Course of Ejectione firmae is now.        Touching the Reports of the Years and Terms of Hen. 4, and  Hen. 5, I can only say, They do not arrive either in the Nature  of the Learning contained in them, or in the Judiciousness and  Knowledge of the Judges and Pleaders, nor in any other Respect  arise to the Perfection of the last Twelve Years of Edw. 3.      But the Times of Hen. 6,as also of Edw. 4, Edw. 5, and Hen.  7, were Times that abounded with Learning and excellent Men.  There is little Odds in the Usefulness or Learning of these  Books, only the first Part of Hen. 6, is more barren, spending  itself much in Learning of little Moment, and now out of Use; but  the second Part is full of excellent Learning.      In the Times of those Three Kings, Hen. 6, Edw. 4, and Hen.  7, the Learning seems to be much alike. But these Two Things are  observable in them, and indeed generally in all Reports after the  Time of Edw. 3. viz.        First, That Real Actions and Assizes were not so frequent as  formerly, but many Titles of Land were determined in Personal  Actions; and the Reasons hereof seem to be,      1st. Because the Learning of them began by little and little  to be less known or understood.      2dly, The ancient Strictness of preserving Possession to  Possessors till Eviction by Action, began not to be so much in  Use, unless in Cases of Descents and Discontinuances, the latter  necessarily drove the Demandant to his Formedon, or his Cui in  Vita, &c. But the Descents that told Entry were rare, because Men  preserved their Rights to enter, &c. by continual Claims.      3dly, Because the Statute of 8 H. 6. had helped Men to an  Action to recover their Possessions by a Writ of Forcible Entry,  even while the Method of Recovery of Possessions by Ejectments  was not known or used.      The Second Thing observable is, That tho' Pleadings in the  Times of those Kings were far shorter than afterwards, especially  after Hen. 8, yet they were much longer than in the Time of King  Edw. 3 and the Pleaders, yea and the Judges too, became somewhat  too curious therein, so that that Art or Dexterity of Pleading,  which in its Use, Nature and Design, was only to render the Fact  plain and intelligible, and to bring the Matter to judgment with  a convenient Certainty, began to degenerate from its primitive  Simplicity, and the true Use and End thereof, and to become a  Piece of Nicety and Curiosity; which how these later Times have  improved, the Length of the Pleadings, the many and unnecessary  Repetitions, the many Miscarriages of Causes upon small and  trivial Niceties in Pleading, have too much witnessed.      I should now say something touching the Times since Hen. 7 to  this Day, and therefore shall conclude this Chapter with some  general observations touching the Proceedings of Law in these  later Times.      And first, I shall begin where I left before, touching the  Length and Nicety of Pleadings, which at this Day far exceeds not  only that short yet perspicuous Course of Pleading which was in  the Time of Hen. 6, Edw. 4, and Hen. 7, but those of all Times  whatsoever, as our vast Presses of Parchment for any one Plea do  abundantly witness.      And the Reasons thereof seem to be these, viz.        First, Because in ancient Times the Pleadings were drawn at  the Bar, and the Exceptions (also) taken at the Bar, which were  rarely taken for the Pleasure or Curiosity of the Pleader, but  only when it was apparent that the Omission or the Matter  excepted to was for the most part the very Merit and Life of the  Cause, and purposely omitted or mispleaded because his Matter or  Cause would bear no better: But now the Pleadings being first  drawn in Writing, are drawn to an excessive Length, and with very  much Labouriousness and Care enlar ged, lest it might afford an  Exception not intended by the Pleader, and which could be easily  supplied from the Truth of the Case; lest the other Party should  catch that Advantage which commonly the adverse Party studies,  not in Contemplation of the Merits or Justice of the Cause, but  to find a slip to fasten upon, tho' in Truth, either not material  to the Merits of the Plea, or at least not to the Merits of the  Cause, if the Plea were in all Things conform to it.      Secondly, Because those Parts of Pleading which in ancient  Times might perhaps be material, but at this Time are become only  mere Styles and Forms, are still continued with much Religion,  and so all those ancient Forms at first introduced for  Convenience, but now not necessary, or it may be antiquated as to  their Use, are yet continued as Things wonderfully material, tho'  they only swell the Bulk, but contribute nothing to the Weight of  the Plea.      Thirdly, These Pleas being mostly drawn by Clerks, who are  paid for Entries and Copies thereof, the larger the Pleadings  are, the more Profits come to them, and the dearer the Clerk's  Place is, the dearer he makes the Client pay.      Fourthly, An Overforwardness in Courts to give Countenance to  frivolous Exceptions, tho' they make nothing to the true Merits  of the Cause; whereby it often happens that Causes are not  determined according to their Merits, but do often miscarry for  inconsiderable Omissions in Pleading.      But, Secondly, I shall consider what is the Reason that in  the Time of Edw. I one Term contained not above two or three  Hundred Rolls, but at this Day one Term contains two Thousand  Rolls or more.      The Reasons whereof may be these, viz.        1st. Many petty Businesses, as Trespasses and Debts under  40s. are now brought to Westminster, which used to be dispatched  in the County or Hundred Courts; and yet the Plaintiffs are not  to be blamed, because at this Day those inferior Courts are so  ill served, and Justice there so ill administred, that they were  better seek it (where it may be had) at Westminster, tho' at  somewhat more Expence.      2dly, Multitudes of Attorneys practising in the Great Courts  at Westminster, who are ready at every Market to gratify the  Spleen, Spite or Pride, of every Plaintiff.      3dly, A great Increase of People in this Kingdom above what  they were anciently, which must needs multiply Suits.      4thly, A great Increase of Trade and Trading Persons, above  what there were in ancient Times, which must have the like  Effect.      5thly, Multitudes of new Laws, both Penal and others, all  which breed new Questions, and new Suits at Law, and in  particular, the Statute touching the devising of Lands, cum  multis aliis.      6thly, Multiplication of Actions upon the Case, which were  rare formerly, and thereby Wager of Law ousted, which discouraged  many Suits: For when Men were sure, that in case they rested upon  a bare Contract without Specialty, the other Party might wage his  Law, they would not rest upon such Contracts without reducing the  Debt into a Specialty, if it were of any Value, which created  much Certainty, and accorded many Suits.      And herewith I shall conclude this Chapter, shewing what  Progress the Law has made, from the Reign of King Edw. I down to  these Times.      IX. Concerning the settling of the Common Law of England in  Ireland and Wales: And some Observations touching the Isles of  Man, Jersey, and Guernsey, etc.        The Kingdom of Ireland being conquered by Hen. 2. about the  Year 1171. He in his Great Council at Oxon, constituted his  younger Son, John, King thereof, who prosecuted that Conquest so  fully, that he introduced the English Laws into that Kingdom, and  swore all the great Men there to the Observation of the same,  which Laws were, after the Decease of King John, again reinforc'd  by the Writ of King Hen. 3. reciting that of King John, Rot.  Claus. 10 H. 3. Memb. 8. & 10. Vide infra, & Pryn. 252, 253, &c.      And because the Laws of England were not so suddenly known  there, Writs from Time to Time issued from hence, containing  divers Capitula Legum Angliae. and commanding their Observation  in Ireland, as Rot. Parl. 11 H. 3. the Law concerning Tenancy by  Curtesy, Rot. Claus. 20 H. 3. Memb. 3. Dorso. The Law concerning  the Preference of the Son born after Marriage, to the Son born of  the same Woman before Marriage, or Bastard eigne & Mulier puisne,  Rot. Clauf. 20 H. 3. Memb. 4. in Dorso: So the Law concerning all  the Parceners inheriting without doing Homage, and several  Transmissions of the like Nature.      For tho' King Hen. 2. had done as much to introduce the  English Laws there, as the Nature of the Inhabitants or the  Circunmstances of the Times would permit; yet partly for want of  Sheriffs, that Kingdom being then not divided into Counties, and  partly by reason of the Instability of the Irisb, he could not  fully effect his Design: And therefore, King John, to supply  those Defects as far as he was able, divided Leinster and Munster  into the several Counties of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Uriel,  Catherlogh, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Limerick,  Tiperary, and Kerry; and appointed Sheriffs and other Officers to  govern 'em after the Manner of England; and likewise caused an  Abstract of the English Laws under his Great Seal to be  transmitted thither, and deposited in the Exchequer at Dublin:  And soon after, in an Irish Parliament, by a general Consent, and  at the Instance of the Irish, he ordain'd, That the English Laws  and Customs should thenceforth be observ'd in Ireland; and in  order to it, he sent his Judges thither, and erected Courts of  Judicature at Dublin.      But notwithstanding these Precautions of King John, yet for  that the Brehon Law, and other Irish Customs, gave more of Power  to the great Men, and yet did not restrain the Common People to  so strict and regular a Discipline as the Laws of England did.  Therefore the very English themselves became corrupted by them,  and the English Laws soon became of little Use or Esteem, and  were look'd upon by the Irish and the degenerate English as a  Yoke of Bondage; so that King Hen. 3. was oftentimes necessitated  to revive. em, and by several successive W rits to join the  Observation of them. And in the Eleventh Year of his Reign, he  sent the following Writ, viz.        Henrici Rex, &c. Baronibus Militibus & aliis liberi  Tenentibus Lageniae, salutem, &c. Satis ut credimus vestra  audivit discretio, quod cum bonae memoriae Johannes, quondam Rex  Angliae Pater noster venit in Hiberniam, ipse duxit secum viros  discretos & Legis peritos, quorum Communi Consilio, & ad  instantiam Hiberniensium Statuit & praecepit Leges Anglicanas  teneri in Hibernia, ita quod Leges easdem in scriptis readactas  reliquit sub sigillo suo ad Scaccar. Dublin.

And Note, In the same Year another Writ was sent to the Lord  Justice, commanding him to aid the Episcopal Excommunications in  Ireland with the Secular Arm, as in England was used.      And about this Time, Hubert de Burgo, the Chief Justice of  England, and Earl of Kent, was made Earl of Connaught, and Lord  Justice of Ireland during Life; and because he could not  personally attend, he on March the 10th, 1227, appointed Richard  de Burgo, to be his Deputy, or Lord Justice, to whom the King  sent the following Writ:        Rex dilecto & fideli suo Richardo de Burgo Justiciario suo  Hiberniae salutem. Mandamus vobis firmiter praecipientes,  quatenus certo die & loco faciatis venire coram vobis,  Archiepiscopos, Episcopos, Abbates, Priores, Comites & Barones,  Milites & libere Tenentes & Ballivos singulorum Comitatuum, &  coram eis publice legi faciatis Chartam Domini Johannis Regis  Patris nostri, cui sigillum suum appensum est, quam fieri fecit,  & jurari a Magnatibus Hiberniae de Legibus & consuetudinibus  Anglorum observandis in Hibernia, & Praecipiatis eis ex parte  nostra, quod Leges illas & consuetudines in Charta praedicta  contentas de cetero firmiter teneant & observent. Et hoc idem per  singulos Comitatus Hiberniae clamari faciatis, & teneri  prohibentes firmiter ex parte nostra & forisiacturam nostram, ne  quis contra hoc Mandatum nostrum, venire praesumat.

Super quo respectum dedimus  Magnat. nostri de Hib. usque ad Terminum praedict' Teste Meipso  apud Westm. 8?die Maii, Anno Regni Nostri 12?        And about the 20th Year of Hen. 3. several Writs were sent  into Ireland, especially directing several Statutes which had  been made in England to be put in Use, and to be observed in  Ireland; as the Statute of Merton in the Case of Bastardy, &c.      But yet it seems by the frequent Grants that were made  afterwards to particular Native Irish Men, quod legibus utantur  Anglicanis, That the Native Irish had not the full Privilege of  the English Laws, in Relation at least to the Liberties of  English Men, till about the Third of Edw. 3. Vide Rot. Claus. 2  E. 3. Memb. 17.      As the Common Law of England was thus by King John and Hen.  3. introduced into Ireland, so in the Tenth of Hen. 7. all the  precedent Statutes of England were there settled by the  Parliament of Ireland. 'Tis true, many ancient Irish Customs  continued in Ireland, and do continue there even unto this Day;  but such as are contrary to the Laws of England are disallow'd  Vide Davis's Reports, the Case of Tanistry.        As touching Wales, That was not always the Feudal Territory  of the Kingdom of England; but having been long governed by a  Prince of their own, there were very many Laws and Customs used  in Wales, utterly strange to the Laws of England, the Principal  whereof they attribute to their King Howell Dha.      After King Edw. I had subdued Wales, and brought it  immediately under his Dominion; He first made a strict  Inquisition touching the Welsh Laws within their several Commotes  and Seigniores, which Inquisitions are yet of Record: After  which, in the 12th of Edw. I. the Statute of Rutland was made,  whereby the Administration of Justice in Wales was settled in a  Method very near to the Rule of the Law of England. The Preamble  of the said Statute is notable, viz.        Edvardus Dei gratia Rex Angliae Dominus Hiberniae & Dux  Acquitaniae omnibus Fidelibas suis de Terra sua de Snodon & de  aliis terris suis in Wallia Salutem in Domino. Divina Providentia  quae in sua Dispositione non fallitur, inter alia suae  Dispensationis Munera, quibus nos & Regnum nostrum Angliae  decorari dignata est, Terram Walliae cum incolis suis prius nobis  juri Feodali subjectam, tam sui gratia in proprietatis nostrae  Dominium, obstaculis quibuscunque cessantibus, totaliter & cum  integritate convertit, & Coroniae Regni praedicti tantum partem  corporis ejusdem annexuit & univit. Nos, &c.        According to the Method in that Statute prescribed, has the  Method of Justice been hitherto administred in Wales, with such  Alterations and additions therein as have been made by the  several subsequent Statutes of 27 and 34 H. 8. &c.      Touching the Isle of Man. This was sometimes Parcel of the  Kingdom of Norway, and governed by Particular Laws and Customs of  their own, tho' many of them hold Proportion, or bear some  Analogy, to the Laws of England, and probably were at first and  originally derived from hence; seeing the Kingdom of Norway as  well as the Isle of Man have anciently been in Subjection to the  Crown of England. Vide Legis Willi. Primi, in Lambard's Saxon  Laws.      Berwick was sometimes Parcel of Scotland, but was won by  Conquest by King Edw. I, and after that lost by King Edw. 2, and  afterwards regained by Edw. 3. It was governed by the Laws of  Scotland, and their own particular Customs, and not according to  the Rules of the Common Law of England, further than as by Custom  it is there admitted, as in Liber Parliamenti, 21 E. I. in the  Case of Moyne and Bartlemew, Pro Dote in Berwick; yet now by  Charter, they send Burgesses to the Parliament of England.      Touching the Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Sark, and Alderney;  They were anciently a Part of the Dutchy of Normandy, and in that  Right, the Kings of England held them till the Time of King John;  but although King John, as is before shewn, was unjustly deprived  of that Dutchy, yet he kept the Islands; and when after that,  they were by Force taken from him, he by the like Force regained  them, and they have ever since continued in the Possession of the  Crown of England.      As to their Laws, they are not governed by the Laws of  England, but by the Laws and Customs of Normandy. But not as they  are at this Day; for since the actual Division and Separation of  those Islands from that Dutchy, there have been several New  Edicts and Laws made by the Kings of France which have much  altered the old Law of Normandy, which Edicts and Laws bind not  in those Islands, they having been ever since King John's Time at  least under the actual Allegiance of England.      And hence it is, that tho' there be late Collections of the  Laws and Customs of Normandy, as Terrier and some others, yet  they are not of any Authority it those Islands; for the Decision  of Controversies, as the Grand Contumier of Normandy is, which is  (at least in the greatest Part thereof) a Collection of the Laws  of Normandy as they stood before the Disjoining of those Islands  from the Dutchy, viz. before the Time of King Hen. 3. tho' there  be in that Collection some Edicts of the Kings of France which  were made after that Disjunction; and those Laws, as I have shewn  before, tho' in some Things they agree with the Laws of England,  yet in many Things they differ, and in some are absolutely  repugnant.      And hence it is, that regularly Suits arising in those  Islands are not to be tried or determined in the King's Courts in  England, but are to be heard, tried, and determined in those  Islands, either before the ordinarY Courts of Jurats there, or by  the Justices Itinerant there, commissioned under the Great Seal  of England, to determine Matters there arising; and the Reason  is, because their Course of Proceedings, and their Laws, differ  from the Course of Proceedings and the Laws of England.      And altho' it be true, that in ancient Times, since the Loss  of Normandy, some scattering Instances are of Pleas moved here  touching Things done in those Islands, yet the general settled  Rule has been to remit them to those Islands, to be tried and  determined there by their Law; tho' at this Day the Courts at  Westminster hold Plea of all transitory Actions wheresoever they  arise, for it cannot appear upon the Record where they did arise.      Mic. 42 E. 2. Rot. 45. coram Rege. A great Complaint was made  by Petition, against the Deputy Governor of those Islands, for  divers Oppressions and Wrongs done there: This Petition was by  the Chancellor delivered into the Court of B. R. to proceed upon  it, whereupon there were Pleadings on both Sides; but because it  appeared to be for Things done and transacted in the said  Islands, Judgment was thus given:        Et quia Negotiam praedict' in Curia hic terminari non potest,  eo quod Juratores Insulae praedict' coram Justitiariis hic venire  non possunt, nec de Jure debent, nec aliqua Negotia infra Insula  praedicta emergentia terminari non debent, nisi secundum Consuet.  Insulae Praedictae. Ideo Recordum retro traditur Cancellario ut  inde fiat Commissio Domini Regis ad Negotia praedicta in Insula  praedicta audienda & Terminanda secundum Consuet' Insulae  praedictae.        And accordingly 14 Junii, 1565, upon a Report from the  Attorney General, and Advice with the two Chief Justices, a  general Direction was given by the Queen and her Council, That  all Suits between the Islanders, or wherein one Party was an  Islander, for Matters arising within the Islands, should be there  heard and determined.      But still this is to be taken with this Distinction and  Limitation, viz. That where the Suit is immediately for the King,  there the King may make his Suit in any of the Courts here,  especially in the Court of King's-Bench: For Instance, in a Quare  Impedit brought by the King in B. R. here for a Church in those  Islands; so in a Qiuo Warranto for Liberties there; so a Demand  of Redemption of Lands sold by the King's Tenant within a Year  and a Day according to the Custom of Normandy; so in an  Information for a Riot, or grand Contempt against a Governor  deputed by the King. These and the like Suits have been  maintained by the King in his Court of King's-Bench here, tho'  for Matters arising within those Islands: This appears, Paschae  16 E. 2. coram Rege, Rot. 82. Mich. 18 E. 2. Rot. 123, 124, 125.  & Pas. I E. 3. Rot. 59.      And for the same Reason it is, that a Writ of Habeas Corpus  lies into those Islands for one imprisoned there, for the King  may demand, and must have an Account of the Cause of any of his  Subjects Loss of Liberty; and therefore a Return must be made of  this Writ, to give the Court an Account of the Cause of  Imprisonment; for no Liberty, whether of a County Palatine, or  other, holds Place against those Brevia Mandatoria, as that great  Instance of punishing the Bishop of Durham for refusing to  execute a Writ of Habeas Corpus out of the King's Bench, 33 E. I.  makes evident.      And as Pleas arising in the Islands regularly, ought not in  the first Instance to be deduced into the Courts here, (except in  the King's Case;) so neither ought they to be deduced into the  King's Courts here in the second Instance; and therefore if a  Sentence or Judgment be given in the Islands, the Party grieved  thereby, may have his Appeal to the King and his Council to  reverse the same if there be Cause. And this was the Course of  Relief in the Dutchy of Normandy, viz. by Appeal to the Duke and  his Council; and in the same Manner, it is still observed in the  Case of erroneous Decrees or Sentences in those Islands, viz. To  appeal to the King and his Council.      But the Errors in such Decrees or Sentences are not examined  by Writ of Error in the King's-Bench, for these Reasons, viz.      1st. Because the Courts there, and those here, go not by the  same Rule, Method, or Order of Law.      And 2dly, Because those Islands, though they are Parcel of  the Dominion of the Crown of England, yet they are not Parcel of  the Realm of England, nor indeed ever were; but were anciently  Parcel of the Dutchy of Normandy, and are those Rewains thereof  which the Power of the Crown and Kingdom of France have not been  able to wrest from the Kings of England.        X. Concerning the Communication of the Laws of England unto the  Kingdom of Scotland        Because this Inquiry will be of Use, not only in itself, but  also as a Parallel Discovery of the Transmission of the English  Laws into Scotland, as before is shewn they were into Normandy; I  shall in this Chapter pursue and solve their several Queries,  viz.      1st, What Laws of Scotland hold a Congruity and Suitableness  with those of England.      2dly, Whether these be a sufficient Ground for us to suppose,  that that Similitude or Congruity began with a Conformation of  their Laws to those of England. And,      3dly, What might be reasonably judged to be the Means or  Reason of the Conformation of their Laws unto the Laws of  England.        As to the First of these Inquiries; It is plain, beyond all  Contradiction, that many of the Laws of Scotland hold a Congruity  and Similitude, and many of them a perfect Identity with the Laws  of England, at least as the English Laws stood in the Times of  Hen. 2. Richard I. King John, Henry 3. and Edw. I. And altho, in  Scotland, Use hath always been made of the Civil Law, in point of  Direction or Guidance, where their Municipal Laws, either  Customary or Parliamentary failed; yet as to their particular  Municipal Laws, we shall find a Resemblance, Parity and Identity,  in their Laws with the Laws of England, anciently in Use; and we  need go no further for Evidence hereof, than the Regiam  Majestatem, a Book published by Mr Skeen in Scotland. It would be  too long to Instance in all the Points that might be produced;  and therefore I shall single out some few, remitting the Reader  for his further Satisfaction to the Book itself.      Dower of the Wife to be the Third Part of her Husband's Lands  of Inheritance; the Writ to recover the same; the Means of  forfeiting thereof by Treason or Felony of the Husband or  Adultery of the Wife; are in great Measure conformable to the  Laws of England. Vide Regiam Majestatem, Lib. 2. cap. 16, 17. and  Quoniam Attachiamento, cap. 85.      The Exclusion of the Descent to the elder Brother by his  receiving Homage, which tho' now antiquated in England, was  anciently received here for Law, as appears by Glanville, Lib. 7.  cap. I. and Vide Regiam Majestatem, Lib. 2. cap. 22.      The Exclusion of Daughters from Inheritances by a Son: The  Descent to all the Daughters in Coparcenary for want of Sons; the  chief House allotted to the eldest Daughter upon this Partition;  the Descent to the Collateral Heirs, for want of Lineal, &c.

The Division of the Deceased's Goods, one Third to the Wife,  another Third to the Children, and another to the Executor, &c.  conformable to the ancient Law of England, and the Custom of the  North to this Day. Lib. 2. cap. 37.      Also the Proceedings to recover Possessions, by  Mortdancester, Juris Utrum, Assise de Novel disseisin, &c. The  Writs and Process are much the same with those in England, and  are directed according to Glanville, and the old Statutes in the  Time of Edw. I. and Hen. 3. Vide Regiam Majestat. Lib. 3. cap. 27  to 36.      Many more Instances might be given of many of the Municipal  Laws of Scotland, either precisely the same with those in  England, or very near, and like to them: Tho' it is true, they  have some particular Laws that hold not that Conformity to ours,  which were introduced either by particular or common Customs, or  by Acts of their Parliaments. But, by what has been said and  instanced in, it appears, That like as hetween the Laws of  England and Normandy, so also between the Laws of England and  Scotland, there was anciently a great Similitude and Likeness.      I come therefore to the Second Thing I proposed to enquire  into, viz. what Evidence there is, That those Laws of Scotland  were either desumed from the English Laws, or from England,  transmitted thither in such a Manner, as that the Laws here in  England were as it were the Original or prime Exemplar, out of  which those parallel or similar Laws of Scotland were copied or  transcribed into the Body of their Laws: And this appears evident  on the following Reasons, viz.        First, For that Glanville (which, as has been observed, is  the ancientest Collection we have of English Laws) seem to be  even transcribed in many entire Capita of the Laws  above-mentioned, and in some others where Glanville doubts, that  Book doubts; and where Glanville follows the Practice of the Laws  then in Use, tho' altered in succeeding Times, at least after the  Reign of Edw. I. there the Regiam Majestatem does accordingly;  for Instance, viz.      Glanville, Lib. 7. cap. I. determines, That a Man can't give  away part of the Lands which he held by Hereditary Descent unto  his Bastard, without the Consent of his Heir, and that he may not  give all his Purchases from his eldest Son; and this is also  declared to be the Law of Scotland accordingly, Regiam  Majestatem, Lib. 2. cap. 19, 20. Tho' since Glanville's Time, the  Law has been altered in England.      Also Glanville, Lib. 7. cap. I. makes a great Doubt, Whether  the second Son, being enfeoffed by the Father, and dies without  Issue; whether the Land shall return to the Father, or descend to  his eldest, or to his youngest Brother; and at last gives such a  Decision as we find almost in the same Terms and Words recited in  the Question and Decisions laid down in Regiam. Majest. Lib. 2.  cap. 22.      Again, Glanville, Lib. 7. cap. I. makes it a difficult  Question in his Time, Whether the eldest Son dying in the  Life-time of his Father, having Issue, the Nephew or the youngest  Son shall inherit; and gives the Arguments Pro & contra: And  Regiam Majestatem, cap. 33. seems to be even a Transcript thereof  out of Glanville.      And further, the Tract concerning Assizes, and the Time of  Limitation, the very Form of the Writs, and the Method of the  Process, and the Directions touching their Proceedings are but  Transcripts of Glanville, as appears by comparing Regiam  Majestatem, Lib. 3. cap. 36. with Glanville, Lib. 13. cap. 32.  and the Collector of those Laws of Scotland in all the  before-mentioned Places, and divers others, quotes Glanville as  the Pattern at least of those Laws.      But Secondly, A second Evidence is, because many of the Laws  which are mentioned in the Regiam Majestatem quoniam Archiamento,  and other Collections of the Scotish Laws, are in Truth very  Translations of several Statutes made in England in the Times of  King Hen. 3. and King Edw. I. For Instance; the Statute of their  King Robert 2. cap. I. touching Alienations to Religious Men, is  nothing else but an Enacting of the Statute of Mortmain, 13 E. 1.  cap. 13. The Law above-mentioned, touching the Disparagement of  Wards, is desumed out of Magna Charta, cap. 6. and the Statute of  Merton, cap. 6. So the Law abovesaid, against Ravishers of Wards,  is taken out of Westm. 2. cap. 35. So the said Law of the double  Value of Marriage, is taken out of Westm. 1. cap. 22. The Law  concerning Wreck of the Sea, is but a Transcript out of Westm. 1.  cap. 4. and divers other Instances of like Nature might be given,  whereby it may appear, that very many of those Laws in Scotland  which are a part of their Corpus Juris, bear a Similitude to the  Laws of England, and were taken as it were out of those Common or  Statute Laws here, that obtain'd in the Time of Edw. I and  before, but especially such as were in Use or Enacted in the Time  of Edw. I and the Laws of England, relative to those Matters,  were as it were the Original and Exemplar from whence those  Similar or Parallel Laws of Scotland were derived or borrowed.      Thirdly, I come now to consider the Third Particular, viz. By  what Means, or by what Reason this Similitude of Laws in England  and Scotland happened, or upon what Account, or how the Laws of  England at least in many Particulars, or Capita Legum, came to be  communicated into Scotland, and they seem to be principally these  two, viz. First, The Vicinity of that Kingdom to this. And  Secondly, The Subjection of that Kingdom  unto the Kings of  England, at least for some considerable Time.      Touching the former of these; First, It is very well known,  that England and Scotland made but one Island, divided not by the  Sea or any considerable Arm thereof, but only by the Interjacency  of the River Tweed, and some Desart Ground, which did not hinder  any easy common Access of the People of the one Kingdom to the  other: And by this Means, First, The Intercourse of Commerce  between that Kingdom and this was very frequent and usual,  especially in the Northern Counties, and this Intercourse of  Commerce brought unto those of Scotland an Acquaintance and  Familiarity with our English Laws and Customs, which in Process  of Time were adopted and received gradually into Scotland.      Again, Secondly, This Vicinity gave often Opportunities of  transplanting of Persons of either Nation into the other,  especially in those Northern Parts, and thereby the English  transplanted and carried with them the Use of their Native  Customs of England, and the Scots transplanted hither, became  acquainted with our Customs, which by occasional Remigrations  were gradually translated and became diffus'd and planted in  Scotland; and it is well known, that upon this Account some of  the Nobility and great Men of Scotland had Possessions here as  well as there: The Earls of Angus were not only Noblemen of  Scotland, but were also Barons of Parliament here, and sate in  our English Parliaments, as appears by the Summons to Parliament,  Tempore Edvardi Tertii.      Again, Thirdly, The Kings of Scotland had Feodal Possessions  here; for Instance, The Counties of Cumberland, Northumberland  and Westmoreland, were anciently held of the Crown of England by  the Kings of Scotland, attended with several Vicissitudes and  Changes until the Feast of St. Michael, 1237, at which Time  Alexander King of Scotland finally released his Pretensions  thereunto, as appears by the Deed thereof enter'd into the  Red-Book of the Exchequer, and the Parliament Book of 20 E. I.  and in Consideration thereof, Hen. 3. gave him the Lands of  Penreth and Sourby, Habend' sibi Heredibus suis Regibus Scotiae,  and by Virtue of that Special Limitation, they came to John the  eldest Son of the eldest Daughter of Alexander King of Scotland,  together with that Kingdom; but the Land of Tindale, and the  Manor of Huntingdon, which were likewise given to him and his  Heirs, but without that Special Limitation, Regibus Scotiae, fell  in Coparcenry, one Moiety thereof to the said John King of  Scotland, as the Issue of the eldest Daughter, and the other  Moiety to Hastings, who was descended from the younger Daughter  of the said Alexander: But those Possessions came again to the  Crown of England by the Forfeiture of King John of Scotland, who  through the Favour of the King of England he had Restitution of  the Kingdom of Scotland, yet never had Restitution of those  Possessions he had in England, and forfeited and lost by his  levying War against the Kingdom of England, as aforesaid.      And thus I have shewn, that the Vicinity of the Kingdoms of  England and Scotland, and the Consequence thereof, viz.  Translations of Persons and Families, Intercourse of Trade and  Commerce, and Possessions obtained by the Natives of each Kingdom  in the other, might be one Means for communicating our Laws to  them.      But Secondly, There was another Means far more effectual for  that End, viz. The Superiority and Interest that the Kings of  England obtain'd over the Crown and Kingdom of Scotland, whereby  it is no Wonder that many of our English Laws were transplanted  thither by the Power of the English Kings. This Interest,  Dominion, or Superiority of the Kings of England in the Realm of  Scotland may be considered these Two Ways, viz. 1st. How it stood  antecedently to the Reign of King Edw. I. And 2dly, How it stood  in his Time.      Touching the former of those, I shall not trouble myself with  collecting Arguments or Authorities relating thereto; he that  desires to see the whole Story thereof, let him consult  Walsingham, sub Anno 18 Edw. I. as also Rot. Parl. 12 R. 2. Pars  secunda, No. 3. Rot. Claus. 29 E. I. M. 10. Dorso, and the Letter  of the Nobility to the Pope asserting it. Ibid.      And this might be one Means, whereby the Laws of England in  elder Times might in some Measure be introduced into Scotland.      But I rather come to the Times of King Edw. I who was  certainly the greatest Refiner of the English Laws, and  studiously endeavoured to enlarge the Dominions of the Crown of  England, so to extend and propagate the Laws of England into all  Parts subject to his Dominion. This Prince, besides the ancient  Claim he made to the Superiority of the Crown of England over  that of Scotland, did for many Years actually enjoy that  Superiority in its full Extent, and the Occasion and Progress  thereof was thus, as it is related by Walsingham, and consonantly  to him appears by the Records of those Times, viz. King Edw. I.  having formerly received the Homage and Fealty of Alexander King  of Scots, as appears Rot. Claus. 5 E. I. M. 5. Dorso, was taken  to be Superior Dominus Scotiae Regni.      Alexander dying, left Margaret his only Daughter, and she  dying without Issue, about 18 E. I. there fell a Controversy  touching the Succession of the Crown of Scotland, between the  King of Norway claiming as Tenant by the Curtesy, Robert de Bruce  descended from the younger Daughter of David King of Scots, and  John de Baliol descended from the elder Daughter, with divers  other Competitors.      All the Competitors submit their Claim to the Decision of  Edw. I. King of England as Superior Dominus Regni Scotiae, who  thereupon pronounced his Sentence for John de Baliol, and  accordingly put him in Possession of the Kingdom, and required  and received his Homage.      The King of England, notwithstanding this, kept still the  Possession, & Insignia of his Superiority. his Court of King'  sBench sate actually at Roxborough in Scotland, Mich. 20, 21 Ed.  I. coram Rege, and upon Complaint of Injuries done by the said  John King of Scots, now restor'd to his Kingdom, he summoned him  often to answer in his Courts, Mich. 21, 22 Edw. I. Northumh.  Scot. He was summoned by the Sheriff of Northumberland to answer  to Walbesi in the King's Court, Pas. 21. E. I. coram Rege. Rot.  34. He was in like wanner summoned to answer John Mazune in the  King's-Bench for an Injury done to him, and Judgment given  against the King of Scots, and that judgment executed.      John King of Scots, being not contented with this Subjection,  did in the 24th Year of King Edw. I resign back his Homage to  King Edward, and bid Defiance to him; wherefore King Edw. I the  same Year with a powerful Army entered Scotland, took the King of  Scots Prisoner, and the greatest part of that Kingdom into his  Possession, and appointed the Earl Warren to be Custos Regni,  Cressingham to be his Treasurer, and Ormsby his Justice, and  commanded his Judges of his Courts of England to issue the King  of England's Writs into Scotland.      And when in the 27th Year of his Reign, the Pope, instigated  by the French King, interpos'd in the Behalf of the King of  Scotland, he and his Nobility resolutely denied the Pope's  Intercession and Mediation.      Thus the Kingdom of Scotland continued in an actual  Subjection to the Crown of England for many Years; for Rot.  Claus. 33 E. I. Membr. 13. Dorso, and Rot. Claus. 34 E. I. Memb.  3. Dorso; several Provisions are made for the better ordering of  the Government of Scotland.      What Proceedings there were herein in the Time of Edw. 2 and  what Capitulations and Stipulations were afterwards made by King  Edw. 3 upon the Marriage of his Sister by Robert de Bruce  touching the Relaxation of the Superius Dominium of Scotland, is  not pertinent to what I aim at, which is, to shew how the English  Laws that were in Use and Force in the Time of Edw. I obtained to  be of Force in Scotland, which is but this, viz.      King Edward I having thus obtained the actual Superiority of  the Crown of Scotland, from the Beginning of the Reign until his  20th Year, and then placing John de Baliol in that Kingdom, and  yet continuing his Superiority thereof, and keeping his Courts of  Justice, and exercising Dominion and Jurisdiction by his Officers  and Ministers in the very Bowels of that Kingdom, and afterwards  upon the Defection of this King John, in the 24th of Edw. I  taking the whole Kingdom into his actual Administration, and  placing his own Judges and great Officers there, and commanding  his Courts of King's-Bench (&c.) here, to Issue their Process  thither, and continuing in the actual Administration of the  Government of that Kingdom during Life: It is no Wonder that  those Laws, which obtained and were in Use in England, in and  before the Time of this King, were in a great Measure translated  thither; and possibly either by being enacted in that Kingdom, or  at least for so long Time, put in Use and Practice there, many of  the Laws in Use and Practice here in England were in his Time so  rivetted and settled in that Kingdom, that 'tis no Wonder to find  they were not shaken or altered by the liberal Concessions made  afterwards by King Edw. 3 upon the Marriage of his Sister; but  that they remain Part of the Municipal Laws of that Kingdom to  this Day.      And that which renders it more evident, That this was one of  the greatest Means of fixing and continuing the Laws of England  in Scotland, is this, viz. This very King Edw. I was not only a  Martial and Victorious, but also a very Wise and Prudent Prince,  and one that very well knew how to use a Victory, as well as  obtain it: And therefore knew it was the best Means of keeping  those Dominions he had powerfully obtain' d, by substituting and  translating his own Laws into the Kingdom which he had thus  subdued. Thus he did upon his Conquest of Wales; and doubtless  thus he did upon his Conquest of Scotland, and those Laws which  we find there so nearly agreeing with the Laws of England used in  his Time, especially the Statutes of Westm. 1 and Westm. 2 are  the Monuments and Footsteps of his Wisdom and Prudence.      And, as thus he was a most Wise Prince, and to secure his  Acquests, introduced many other Laws of his Native Kingdom into  Scotland; so he very well knew the Laws of England were excellent  Laws fitted for the due Administration of Justice to the  Constitution of the Governed, and fitted for the Preservation of  the Peace of a Kingdom, and for the Security of a Government: And  therefore he was very solicitous, by all prudent and careful  Means imaginable, to graft and plant the Laws of England in all  Places where he might, having before-hand used all possible Care  and Industry for Rectifying and Refining the English Laws to  their greatest Perfection.      Again, It seems very evident, that the Design of King Edw. I  was by all Means possible to unite the Kingdom of Scotland (as he  had done the Principality of Wales) to the Crown of England, so  that thereby Britain might have been one entire Monarchy,  including Scotland as well as Wales and England under the same  Sceptre; and in order to the accomplishing thereof, there could  not have been a better Means than to make the Interest of  Scotland one with England, and to knit 'em as it were together in  one Communion, which could never have been better done than by  establishing one Common Law and Rule of Justice and Commerce  among them; and therefore he did, as Opportunity and Convenience  served, translate over to that Kingdom as many of our English  Customs and Laws as within that Compass of Time he conveniently  could.      And thus I have given an Essay of the Reasons and Means, how  and why we find so many Laws in Scotland parallel to those in  England, and holding so much of Congruity and Likeness to them.      And the Reason why we have but few of their Laws that  correspond with ours of a later Date than Edw. I or at least Edw.  2 is because since the Beginning of Edw. 3 that Kingdom has been  distinct, and held little Communion with us till the Union of the  two Crowns in the Person of King James I and in so great an  Interval it must needs he, that by the Intervention and  Succession of new Laws, much of what was so ancient as the Times  of Edw. I and Edw. 2 have received many Alterations: So that it  is a great Evidence of the Excellency of our English Laws, that  there remain to this Day so many of them in Force in that Part of  Great Britain continuing to bear Witness, that once that  excellent Prince Edw. I exercised Dominion and Jurisdiction  there.      And thus far of the Communion of the Laws of England to  Scotland, and of the Means whereby it was effected; from whence  it may appear, That as in Wales, Ireland and Normandy, so also in  Scotland, such Laws which in those Places have a Congruity or  Similitude with the Laws of England, were derived from the Laws  of England, as from their Fountain and Original, and were not  derived from any of those Places to England.     XI. Touching the Course of Descents in England        Among the many Preferences that the Laws of England have  above others, I shall single out Two particular Titles which are  of Common Use, wherein their Preference is very visible, and the  due Consideration of their Excellence therein, may give us a  handsome Indication or Specimen of their Excellencies above other  Laws in other Parts or Titles of the same also.      Those Titles, or Capitula Legum, which I shall single out for  this Purpose, are these Two, viz. 1st, The hereditary  Transmission of Lands from Ancestor to Heir, and the Certainty  thereof: and 2dly, The Manner of Trial by Jury, which, as it  stands at this Day settled in England, together with the  Circumstances and Appendixes thereof, is certainly the best  Manner of Trial in the World; and I shall herein give an Account  of the successive Progress of those Capitula Legis, and what  Growth they have had in Succession of Time till they arriv'd so  that State and Perfection which they have now obtain'd.      First, Then, touching Descents and hereditary Transmissions:  It seems by the Laws of the Greeks and Romans, that the same Rule  was held both in Relation to Lands and Goods, where they were not  otherwise disposed of by the Ancestor, which the Romans therefore  called Successio ab intestato; but the Customs of particular  Countries, and especially here in England, do put a great  Difference, and direct a several Method in the Transmission of  Goods or Chattels, and that of the Inheritances of Lands.      Now as to hereditary Transmissions or Successions, commonly  called with us Descents, I shall hold this Order in my Discourse,  viz.      First, I shall give some short Account of the ancient Laws  both of the Jews, the Greeks, and the Romans, touching this  Matter.      Secondly, I shall observe some Things wherein it may appear,  how the particular Customs or Municipal Laws of other Countries  varied from those Laws, and the Laws here formerly used.      Thirdly, I shall give some Account of the Rules and Laws of  Descents or hereditary Transmissions as they formerly stood, and  as at this Day they stand in England, with the successive  Alterations, that Process of Time, and the Wisdom of our  Ancestors, and certain Customs grown up, tacitly, gradually, and  successively have made therein.      And First, touching the Laws of Succession, as well of  Descent of Inheritances of Lands, as also of Goods and Chattels,  which among the Jews was the same in both.      Mr Selden, in his Book De Successionibus apud Hebraeos, has  given us an excellent Account, as well out of the Holy Text as  out of the Comments of the Rabins, or Jewish Lawyers, touching  the same, which you may see at large in the 5th, 6th, 7th, 12th  and 13th Chapters of that Book; and which, for so much thereof as  concerns my present Purpose, I shall briefly comprise under the  Eight following Heads, viz.        First, That in the Descending Line, the Descent or Succession  was to all the Sons, only the eldest Son had a double Portion to  any one of the rest, viz. If there were three Sons, the Estate  was to be divided into four Parts, of which the eldest was to  have two Fourth Parts, and the other two Sons were to have one  Fourth Part each.      Secondly, If the Son died in his Father's Life-time, then the  Grandson, and so in lnfinitum, succeeded in the Portion of his  Father, as if his Father had been in Possession of it, according  to the Jus Representationis now in Use here.      Thirdly, The Daughter did not succeed in the Inheritance of  the Father as long as there were Sons, or any Descendants from  Sons in Being; but if any of the Sons died in the Life-time of  his Father having Daughters, but without Sons, the Daughters  succeeded in his Part as if he himself had been Possessed.      Fourthly, And in Case the Father left only Daughters and no  Sons, the Daughters equally succeeded to their Father as in  Copartnership, without any Prelation or Preference of the eldest  Daughter to two Parts, or a double Portion.      Fifthly, But if the son had purchased an Inheritance and died  without Issue, leaving a Father and Brothers, the Inheritance of  such Son so dying did not descend to the Brothers, (unless in  Case of the next Brother's taking to Wife the Deceased's Widow to  raise up Children to his deceased Brother) but in such Case the  Father inherited to such Son entirely.      Sixthly, But if the Father in that Case was dead, then it  came to the Brothers, as it were as Heirs to the Father, in the  same Manner as if the Father had been actually Possess'd thereof;  and therefore the Father's other Sons and their Descendants in  Infinitum succeeded; but yet especially, and without any double  Portion to the eldest, because tho' in Truth the Brothers  succeeded as it were in Right of Representation from the Father,  yet if the Father died before the Son, the Descent was de Facto  immediately from the Brother deceased to the other Brothers, in  which Case their Law gave not a double Portion; and in Case the  Father had no Sons or Descendants from them, then it descended to  all the Sisters.      Seventhly, If the Son died without Issue, and his Father or  any Descendants from him were extant, it went not to the  Grandfather or his other Descendants; but if the Father was dead  without Issue, then it descended to the Grandfather, and if he  were dead, then it went to his Sons and their Descendants, and  for want of them, then to his Daughters or their Descendants, as  if the Grandfather himself had been actually possess'd and had  died, and so miutatis mutandis to the Proavus, Abavus, Atavus,  &c. and their Descendants.      Eighthly, But the Inheritance of the Son never resorted to  the Mother, or to any of her Ancestors, but both she and they  were totally excluded from the Succession.        The double Portion therefore that was Jus Primogeniturae,  never took Place but in that Person that was the Primogenitus, of  him from whom the inheritance immediately descended, or him that  represented him; as if A. had two Sons, B. and C. and B. the  eldest had two Sons, D. and E. and then B. died, whereas B.  should have had a double Portion, viz. two Thirds in Case he had  survived his Father; but now this double Portion shall be equally  divided between D. and E. and D. shall not have two Thirds of the  two Thirds that descended from A. to them. Vide Selden, ut supra.      Thus much of the Laws or Rules touching Descents among the  Jews.      Among the Graecians, the Laws of Descents in some Sort  resemble those of the Jews, and in some Things they differed.  Vide Petit's Leges Attica, Cap. I. Tit. 6. De Testamentis &  Hereditario Jure, where the Text of their Law runs thus, viz.        Omnes legitimi Filii Haereditatem Paternam ex aequo inter se  Haeriscunto, si quis intestatus moritur relictis Filiabus qui eas  in Uxores ducunt haeredes sunto, si nullae supersint, hi ab  intestato haereditatem cernunto: Et primo quidem Fratres defuncti  Germani, & legitimi Fratrum Filii haereditatem simil adeunto; si  nulli Fratres aut Fratrum Filii supersint, iis geniti eadem Lege  haereditatem cernunto: Masculi autem iis geniti etiam si  remotiori cognationis sint Gradu, praeferuntor, si nulli  supersint, Paterni proximi, ad sobrinorum usque Filios, Materni  defuncti propinqui simili Lege Haereditatem adeunto; si e neutra  cognatione supersint intra definitum Gradum proximus cognatus  Paternus, addito Notho Nothave; superstite Legitima Filia Nothus  Haereditatem Patris ne adito.        This Law is very obscure, but the Sense thereof seems to be  briefly this, viz. That all the Sons equally shall inherit to the  Father; but if he have no Sons, then the Husbands of the  Daughters; and if he have no Children, then his Brothers and  their Children; and if none, than his next Kindred on the Part of  his Father, preferring the Males before the Females; and if none  of the Father's Line, ad Sobrinorum usque Filios, then to descend  to the Mother's Line. Vide Petit's Gloss thereon.      Among the Romans it appears, that the Laws of Successions or  Descents did successively vary, for the Laws of the Twelve Tables  did exclude the Females from Inheriting, and had many other  Streightnesses and Hardships which were successively remedied:  First, by the Emperor Claudius, and after him by Adrian, in his  Senatus Consultus Tertullianus, and after him hy Justinian in his  Third Institutes, Tit. De Haereditatibus quae ab intestato  deseruntur, and the two ensuing Titles. And again, all this was  further explained and settled by the Novel Constitutions of the  said Justinian, stiled the Authenticae Novellae, cap. 18. De  Haereditatibus ab intestato venientibus & agnatorum Jiure  sublato. Therefore omitting the large Inquiry into the Successive  Changes of the Roman Law in this particular, I shall only set  down how, according to that Constitution, the Roman Law stands  settled therein.      Descents or Successions from any Person are of Three Kinds,  viz. 1st, In the Descending Line. 2dly, The Ascending Line. 3dly,  The Collateral Line; and this latter is either in Agnatos a Parte  Patris, or in Cognatos a Parte Matris.        1. ln the Descending Line, These Rules are by the Roman Law  directed, viz.        1. The Descending Line, (whether Male or Female, whether  immediate or remote) takes Place, and prevents the Descent or  Succession Ascending or Collateral in infinitum.      2. The remote Descents of the Descending Line succeed in  Stirpem, i.e. in that Right which his Parent should have had.      3. This Descent or Succession is equal in all the Daughters,  all the Sons, and all the Sons and Daughters, without preferring  the Male before the Female; so that if the common Ancestor had  three Sons and three Daughters, each of them had a sixth Part;  and if one of them had died in the Life of the Father, having  three Sons and three Daughters, the sixth Part that belonged to  that Party should have been divided equally between his or her  six Children, and so in in finitum in the Descending Line.        2. In the Ascending Line, there are these two Rules, viz.      1. If the Son dies without Issue, or any descending from him,  having a Father and a Mother living, both of them shall equally  succeed to the Son, and prevent all others in the Collateral  Line, except Brothers and Sisters, and if only a Father, or only  a Mother, he or she shall succeed alone.      2. But if the Deceased leaves a Father and a Mother, with a  Brother and a Sister, ex utrisque Parentibus conjuncti, they all  Four shall equally succeed to the Son by equal Parts without  Preference of the Males.        3. In the Collateral Line, (i.e. where the Person dies  without Father or Mother, Son or Daughter, or any descending from  them in the Right Line) the Rules are these, viz.        1. The Brothers and Sisters, ex utrisque Parentibius  conjuncti, and the immediate Children of them, shall exceed  equally without Preference of either Sex, and the Children from  them shall succeed in stirpes; as if there be a Brother and  Sister, and the Sister dies in the Life of the Descendant leaving  one or more Children, all such Children shall succeed in the  Moiety that should have come to their deceased Mother, had she  survived.      2. But if there be no Brothers or Sisters, ex utrisque  Parentibus conjuncti, nor any of their immediate Children, then  the Brothers and Sisters of the half Blood and their immediate  Children shall succeed in Stirpes to the Deceased, without any  Prerogative to the Male.      3. But if there be no Brothers or Sisters of the wbole or  half Blood, nor any of their immediate Children (for the  Grandchildren are not provided for by the Law) then the next  Kindred are called to the Inheritance.      (But by the Author's Leave, I think the Grandchildren are  impliedly provided for, as they succeed their Father or Mother  Jure representationis.)      4. And if the next Kindred be in an equal Degree, whether on  the Part of the Father as Agnati, or on the Part of the Mother as  Cognati, then they are equally called to the Inheritance, and  succeeded in Capita, and not in Stirpes.        Thus far of the settled Laws of the Jews, Greeks, and Romans,  but the Particular or Municipal Laws and Customs of almost every  Country derogate from those Laws, and direct Successions in a  much different Way. For Instance.      By the Customs of Lombardy, according to which the Rules of  the Feuds, both in their Descents and in other Things, are much  directed; their Descents are in a much different Manner, viz.      Leges Feiudarum, Lib. I. Tit. I. If a Feud be granted to one  Brother who dies without Issue, it descends not to his other  Brother unless it be specially provided for in the first  Infeudation: If the Donee dies, having Issue Sons and Daughters,  it descends only to the Sons; whereas by the Roman Law it  descends to both: The Brother succeeds not to the Brother unless  specially provided for, & Ibid. Tit. 50. The Ascendants succeed  not, but only the Descendants, neither does a Daughter succeed  nisi ex Pacto, vel nisi sit Feodum Faemineum If we come nearer  Home to the Laws of Normandy, Lands there are of Two Kinds, viz.  Partible, and not Partible; the Lands that are partible, are  Valvasories, Burgages, and such like, which are much of the  Nature of our Socage Lands; these descend to all the Sons, or to  all the Daughters: Lands not partible, are Fiefs and Dignities,  they descend to the eldest Son, and not to all the Sons; but if  there be no Sons, then to all the Daughters, and become partible.        The Rules and Directions of their Descents are as follow,  viz.      1. For want of Sons or Nephews, it descends to the Daughters;  if there be no Sons or Descendants from them, it goes to  Brothers, and for want of Brothers, to Sisters, (observing as  before the Difference between Lands partible and not partible)  and accordingly the Descent runs to the Posterity of Brothers to  the seventh Degree; and if there be no Brothers nor Sisters, nor  any Descendants from them within the Seventh Degree, it descends  to the Father, and if the Father be dead, then to the Uncles and  Aunts and their Posterity, (as above is said in the Case of  Brothers and Sisters) and if there be none, then to the  Grandfather.      So that according to their Law, the Father is postponed to  the Brother and Sister, and their Issues, but is preferred before  the Uncle: Tho' according to the Jewish Law, the Father is  preferred before the Brother; by the Roman Law, he succeeds  together equally with the Brother; but by the English Law, the  Father cannot take from his Son by an immediate Descent, but may  take as Heir to his Brother, who was Heir to his Son by  Collateral Descent.      2. If Lands descended from the Part of the Father, they could  never resort by a Descent to the Line of the Mother; but in Case  of Purchases by the Son who died without Issue, for want of Heirs  of the Part of the Father, it descended to the Heirs of the Part  of the Mother according to the Law of England.      3. The Son of the eldest Son dying in the Life of the Father,  is preferred before a younger Son surviving his Father as the Law  stands here now settled, tho' it had some Interruption, 4  Johannis.      4. On Equality of Degrees in Collateral Descents, the Male  Line is preferred before the Female.      5. Altho' by the Civil Law, Fratres ex utroque Parente  conjuncti Praeferuntur Fratribus consanguineis tantum vel  uterinis; yet it should seem by the Contumier of Normandy,  Fratres consanguineis ei ex eodem Patre sed diversa Matre, shall  take by Descent together with the Brothers, ex utroque conjuncti,  upon the Death of any such Brothers. But Quere hereof, for this  seems a Mistake; for, as I take it, the half Blood hinders the  Descent between Brothers and Sisters by their Laws as well as  ours.      6. Leprosy was amongst them an Impediment of Succession, but  then it seems it ought to be first solemnly adjudged so by the  Sentence of the Church.      Upon all this, and much more that might be observed upon the  Customs of several Countries, it appears, That the Rules of  Successions, or hereditary Transmissions, have been various in  several Countries according to their various Laws, Customs, and  Usages.      And now, after this brief Survey of the Laws and Customs of  other Countries, I come to the Laws and Usages of England in  relation to Descents, and the Growth that those Customs  successively have had, and whereunto they are now arrived.        First, Touching hereditary Successions: It seems, that  according to the ancient British Laws, the eldest Son inherited  their Earldoms and Baronies; for they had great Dignities and  Jurisdictions annex'd to them, and were in Nature of  Principalities, but that their ordinary Freeholds descended to  all their Sons; and this Custom they carried with them into  Wales, whither they wvere driven. This appears by Statutum  Waltiae 12 E. I. and which runs thus, viz.        Aliter usitatum est in Wallia quam in Anglia quoad  successionem haereditatis; eo quod haereditas partibilis est  inter haeredes Masculos, & a tempore cujus non extiterit Memoria  partibilis exitit. Dominus Rex non vult quod consuetudo illa  abrogetur: sed quod haereditates remaneant partibiles, inter  consimiles haeredes sicut esse Consueverunt; & fiat partitio  illius sicut fieri consuevit. Hoc excepto Bastardi non habeant de  caetero haereditates & etiam quod non habeant purpartes, cum  legitimis nec sine legitimis.        Whereupon Three Things are observable, viz. 1st, That at this  Time the hereditary Succession of the eldest Son was then known  to be the common and usual Law in England. 2dly, That the  Succession of all the Sons was the ancient customary Law among  the British in Wales, which by this Statute was continued to  them. 3dly, That before this Time, Bastards were admitted to  inherit in Wales as well as the Legitimate Children, which Custom  is thereby abrogated; and although we have but few Evidences  touching the British Laws before their Expulsion hence into  Wales, yet this Usage in Wales seems sufficiently to evidence  this to have been the ancient British Law.      Secondly, As to the Times of the Saxons and Danes, their Laws  collected hy Brompton and Mr Lambard, speak not much concerning  the Course of Descents; yet it seems that commonly Descents of  their ordinary Lands at least, except Baronies and Royal  Inheritances, descended also to all the Sons: For amongst the  Laws of King Canutus, in Mr Lambard is the Law, viz. No. 68.  "Sive quis incuria five Morte repentina fuerit intestato mortuus,  Dominus tamen nullam rerum suarum Partem (praeter eam quae jure  debetur Hereoti nomine) sibi assumito. Verum eas Judicio suo  Uxori, Liberis & cognatione proximis juste (pro suo cuique jure)  distributio." Upon which Law, we may observe these five things,  viz.      1st. That the Wife had a Share, as well of the Lands for her  Dower, as of the Goods.      2dly, That in reference to hereditary Successions, there then  seem'd to be little Difference between Lands and Goods, for this  Law makes no Distinction.      3dly, That there was a Kind of settled Right of Succession,  with Reference to Proximity and Remoteness of Blood, or Kin, Et  cognatione proximis pro suo cuique jure.      4thly, That in Reference to Children, they all seem'd to  succeed alike, without any Distinction between Males and Females.      5thly, That yet the Ancestor might dispose of by his Will as  well Lands as Goods, which Usage seems to have obtained here unto  the Time of Hen. 2 as will appear hereafter. Vide Glanville.      Thirdly, It seems that, until the Conquest, the Descent of  Lands was at least to all the Sons alike, and for ought appears  to all the Daughters also, and that there was no Difference in  the hereditary Transmission of Lands and Goods, at least in  Reference to the Children: This appears by the Laws of King  Edward the Confessor, confirm'd by King William I and recited in  Mr Lambard, Folio 167. as also by Mr Selden in his Notes upon  Eadmerus, viz. Lege 36 Tit. De Intestatorum Bonis; Pag. 184. "Si  quis Intestatus obierit, Liberi ejus Haereditatem aequaliter  divident."      But this equal Division of Inheritances among all the  Children was found to be very inconvenient: For,      1st, It weakened the Strength of the Kingdom, for by frequent  parcelling and subdividing of Inheritances, in Process of Time  they became so divided and crumbled, that there were few Persons  of able Estates left to undergo publick Charges and Offices.      2dly, It did by Degrees bring the Inhabitants to a low Kind  of Country living, and Families were broken; and the younger  Sons, which had they not had those little Parcels of Land to  apply themselves to, would have betaken themselves to Trades, or  to Civil or Military, or Ecclesiastical Employments, neglecting  those Opportunities, wholly apply'd themselves to those small  Divisions of Lands, whereby they neglected the Opportunities of  greater Advantage of enriching themselves and the Kingdom.      And therefore King William I having by his Accession to the  Crown gotten into his Hands the Possessions and Demesns of the  Crown, and also very many and great Possessions of those that  oppos'd him, or adhered to Harold, disposed of those Lands or  great Part of them to his Countrymen, and others that adhered to  him, and reserved certain honorary Tenures, either by Baronage,  or in Knights-Service or Grand Serjeancy, for the Defence of the  Kingdom, and possibly also, even at the Desire of many of the  Owners, changed their former Tenures into Knights-Service, which  Introduction of new Tenures was nevertheless not done without  Consent of Parliament; as appears by the additional Laws before  mentioned, that King William made by Advice of Parliament,  mentioned by Mr Selden in his Notes on Eadmerus, Page 191,  amongst which this was one, viz.        Statuimus etiam & firmiter praecipimus ut omnes Comites  Barones Milites & Servientes & universi liberi Homines totius  Regni nostri habeant & teneant se semper in Armis & in Equis ut  decet & oportet, & quod sint semper prompti & bene parati ad  Servitium suum integrum nobis explendendum & peragendum, cum  semper opus fuerit secundum quod nobis de Feodis debent &  tenentur Tenementis suis de Jure facere & sicut illis statuimus  per Commune Concilium totius Regni nostri, Et illis dedimus &  concessimus in Feodo Jure haereditario.        Whereby it appears, that there were two Kinds of Military  Provisions; one that was set upon all Freeholds by common Consent  of Parliament, and which was usually called Assisa Armorum; and  another that was Conventional and by Tenure, upon the Infeudation  of the Tenant, and which was usually called Knights Service, and  sometimes Royal, sometimes Foreign Service, and sometimes  Servitium Loricae.      And hence it came to pass, that not only by the Customs of  Normandy, but also according to the Customs of other Countries,  those honorary Fees, or Infeudations, became descendible to the  Eldest, and not to all the Males. And hence also it is, that in  Kent, where the Custom of all the Males taking by Descent  generally prevails, and that pretend a Concession of all their  Customs by the Conqueror, to obtain a Submission to his  Government, according to that Romantick Story of their Moving  Wood: But even in Kent itself, those ancient Tenements or Fees  that are held anciently by Knights Service, are descendible to  the Eldest Son, as Mr Lambard has observed to my Hands in his  Perambulation, Page 533, 553. out of 9 H. 3. Fitz. Prescription  63. 26 H. 8.5. and the Statute of 31 H. 8. cap. 3. And yet even  in Kent, if Gavelkind Lands escheat, or come to the Crown by  Attainder or Dissolution of Monasteries, and be granted to be  held by Knights Service, or Per Baroniam, the Customary Descent  is not changed, neither can it be but by Act of Parliament, for  it is a Custom fix'd to the Land.      But those honorary infeudations made in ancient Times,  especially shortly after the conquest, did silently and suddenly  assume the Rule of Descents to the Eldest, and accordingly held  it; and so altho' possibly there were no Acts of Parliament of  those Elder Times, at least none that are now known of, for  altering the ancient Course of Descents from all the Sons to the  Eldest, yet the Use of the Neighbouring Country might introduce  the same Usage here as to those honorary Possessions.      And because those honorary Infeudations were many, and  scattered almost through all the Kingdom, in a little Time they  introduced a Parity in the Succession of Lands of other Tenures,  as Socages, Valvasories, &c. So that without Question, by little  and little, almost generally in all Counties of England (except  Kent, who were most tenacious of their old Customs in which they  gloried, and some particular Feuds and Places where a contrary  Usage prevailed) the generality of Descents or Successions, by  little and little, as well of Socage Lands as Knights Service,  went to the eldest Son, according to the Declaration of King Edw.  I in the Statute of Wales above mentioned, as will more fully  appear by what follows.      In the Time of Hen. I as we find by his 70th Law, it seems  that the whole Land did not Descend to the eldest Son, but begun  to look a little that Way, viz. Primum Patris Feudum,  Primogenitus Filius habeat. And as to Collateral Descents, that  Law determines thus: "Si quis sine. Liberis decesserit Pater aut  Mater ejus in haereditatem succedat vel Frater vel Soror si Pater  & Mater desint, si nec hos, habeat Soror Patris vel Matris, &  deinceps in Quintum Geniculum; qui cum propinquiores in parentela  sint haereditario jure succedant; & dum Virilis sexus extiterit &  haereditas ab inde sit, Foeminea non haereditetur."      By this Law it seems to appear;      1. The eldest Son, tho' he had Jus Primogeniturae, the  principal Fee of his Father's Land, yet he had not all the Land.      2. That for want of Children, the Father or Mother inherited  before the Brother or Sister.      3. That for want of Children, and Father, Mother, Brother,  and Sister, the Land descended to the Uncles and Aunts to the  fifth Generation.      4. That in Successions Collateral, Proximity of Blood was  preferred.      5. That the Male was preferred before the Female, i.e. The  Father's Line was preferred before the Mother's, unless the Land  descended from the Mother, and then the Mother's Line was  preferred.        How this Law was observed in the interval between Hen. I. and  Hen. 2. we can give no Account of; but the next Period that we  come to is, the Time of Hen. 2. wherein Glanville gives us an  Account how the Law stood at that Time: Vide Glanville, Lib. 7.  Wherein, notwithstanding it will appear, that there was some  Uncertainty and Unsettledness in the Business of Descents or  Hereditary Successions, tho' it was much better polished then  formerly, the Rules then of Succession were either in Reference  to Goods, or Lands. 1st, As to Goods, one Third Part thereof went  to the Wife, another Third Part went to the Children, and the  other Third was left to the Disposition of the Testator; but if  he had no Wife, then a Moiety went to the Children, and the other  Moiety was at the Deceased's Disposal. And the like Rule if he  had left a Wife, but no Children. Glanv. lib. 7. cap. 5. & Vide  lib. 2. cap. 29.      But as to the Succession of Lands, the Rules are these.        First, If the Lands were Knights Service, they generally went  to the eldest Son; and in case of no Sons, then to all the  Daughters; and in case of no Children, then to the eldest  Brother.      Secondly, If the Lands were Socage, they descended to all the  Sons to be divided; Si feurit Soccagium & id antiquitus divisum;  only the Chief House was to be allotted to the Purparty of the  Eldest, and a Compensation made to the rest in lieu thereof: "Si  vero non fuerit antiquitus divisum, tunc Primogenitus secundum  quorundam Consuetudinem totam Haereditatem obtinebit, secundum  autem quorundam Consuetudinem postnatus Filius Haeres est."  Glanville, lib. 7. cap. 3. So that altho' Custom directed the  Descent variously, either to the eldest or youngest, or to all  the Sons, yet it seems that at this Time, Jus Commune, or Common  Right, spoke for the eldest Son to be Heir, no Custom intervening  to the contrary.      Thirdly, As the Son or Daughter, so their Children in  infinitum, are preferred in the Descent before the Collateral  Line or Uncles.      Fourthly, But if a Man had two Sons, and the eldest Son died  in the Life-time of his Father, having Issue a Son or Daughter,  and then the Father dies. it was then controverted, whether the  Sou or Nephew should succeed to the Father, tho' the better  Opiuion seems to be for the Nephew, Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 3.      Fifthly, A Bastard could not inherit, Ibid. cap. 13, or 17.  And altho' by the Canon or Civil Law, if A. have a Son born of B.  before Marriage, and after A. marries B. this Son shall be  legitimate and heritable; yet according to the Laws of England  then, and ever since used, he was not heritable, Glanvil. lib. 7.  cap. 15.      Sixthly, In case the Purchaser died without Issue, the Land  descended to the Brothers; and for want of Brothers, to the  Sisters; and for want of them, to the Children of the Brothers or  Sisters; and for want of them, to the Uncles; and so onward  according to the Rules of Descents at this Day; and the Father or  Mother were not to inherit to the Son, but the Brothers or  Uncles, and their Children. Ibid. cap. 1. & 4.        And it seems, That in all Things else the Rules of Descents  in reference to the Colateral Line were much the same as now; as  namely, That if Lands descended of the Part of the Father, it  should not resort to the Part of the Mother, or e converso; but  in the Case of Purchasers, for want of Heirs of the Part of the  Father, it resorted to the Line of the Mother, and the nearer and  more worthy of Blood were preferred: So that if there were any of  the Part of the Father, tho' never so far distant, it hindred the  Descent to the Line of the Mother, though much nearer.      But in those Times it seems there were two Impediments of  Descents or hereditary Successions which do not now obtain, viz.      First, Leprosy, if so adjudged by Sentence of the Church:  This indeed I find not in Glanville; but I find it pleaded and  allowed in the Time of King John, and thereupon the Land was  adjudged from the Leprous Brother to the Sister. Pasch. 4  Johannis.      Secondly, There was another Curiosity in Law, and it was  wonderful to see how much and how long it prevailed; for we find  it in Use in Glanville, who wrote Temp. Hen. 2. in Bracton Temp.  Hen. 3. in Fleta Temp. Edw. I and in the broken Year of 13 E. I.  Fitzh. Avowry 235. Nemo potest esse Tenens & Dominus, & Homagium  repellit Perquisitum: And therefore if there had been three  Brothers, and the eldest Brother had enfeoffed the second,  reserving Homage, and had received Homage, and then the second  had died without Issue, the Land should have descended to the  youngest Brother and not to the eldest Brother, Qiuia Homagium  repellit perquisitum, as 'tis here said, for he could not pay  Homage to himself. Vide for this, Bracton, Lib. 2. cap. 30.  Glanvil. Lib. 7. cap. I. Fleta, Lib. 6. cap. I.        But at this Day the Law is altered, and so it has been for  ought I can find ever since 13 E. I. Indeed, it is antiquated  rather than altered, and the Fancy upon which it was grounded has  appear'd trivial; for if the eldest Son enfeoff the second,  reserving Homage, and that Homage paid, and then the second Son  dies without Issue, it will descend to the Eldest as Heir, and  the Seigniory is extinct. It might indeed have had some Color of  Reason to have examined, whether he might not have waved the  Descent, in case his Services had been more beneficial than the  Land: But there could be little Reason from thence to exclude him  from the Succession. I shall mention no more of this Impediment,  nor of that of Leprosy, for that they both are vanished and  antiquated long since; and, as the Law now is, neither of these  are any Impediment of Descents.      And now passing over the Time of King John and Richard I  because I find nothing of Moment therein on this Head, unless the  Usurpation of King John upon his eldest Brother's Son, which he  would fain have justified by introducing a Law of prefering the  younger Son before the Nephew descended from the elder Brother:  But this Pretention could no way justify his Usurpation, as has  been already shewn in the Time of Hen. 2.      Next, I come to the Time of Hen. 3 in whose Time the Tractate  of Bracton was written, and thereby in Lib. 2. cap. 30 & 31 and  Lib. 5. cap. It appears, That there is so little Variance as to  Point of Descents between the Law as it was taken when Bracton  wrote, and the Law as afterwards taken in Edw. I's Time, when  Britton and Fleta wrote, that there is very little Difference  between them, as may easily appear by comparing Bracton ubi  supra. & Fleta, Lib. 5. cap. 9. Lib. 6. cap. 1, 2. that the  latter seem to be only Transcripts or Abstracts of the former.  Wherefore I shall set down the Substance of what both say, and  thereby it will appear, that the Rules of Descents in Hen. 3. and  Edw. I's Time were very much one.        First, At this Time the Law seems to be unquestionably  settled, that the eldest Son was of Common Right Heir, not only  in Cases of Knight Service Lands, but also of Socage Lands,  (unless there were a special Custom to the contrary, as in Kent  and some other Places) and so that Point of the Common Law was  fully settled.      Secondly, That all the Descendants in infinitum, from any  Person that had been Heir, if living, were inheritable Jure  representationis; as, the Descendants of the Son, of the Brother,  of the Uncle, &c. And also, Thirdly, That the eldest Son dying in  the Life-time of the Father, his Son or Issue was to have the  Preference as Heir to the Father before the younger Brother, and  so the Doubt in Glanville's Time was settled, Glanvil. Lib. 7,  cap. 3. "Cum quis autem moriatur habens Filium postnatum, & ex  primogenito Filio praemortuo Nepotem, Magna quidem Juris  dubitatio solet isse uter illorum preferendus fit alii in illa  Successioni, scilicet, utrum Filius aut Nepos?"      Fourthly, The Father, or Grandfather, could not by Law  inherit immediately to the Son.      Fifthly, Leprosy, Though it were an Exception to a Plaintiff,  because he ought not to converse in the Courts of Law, as  Bracton, Lib. 5. cap. 20 yet we no where find it to be an  Impediment of a Descent.        So that upon the whole Matter, for any Thing I can observe in  them, the Rules of Descents then stood settled in all Points as  they are at this Day, except some few Matters (which yet soon  after settled as they now stand) viz.        First, That Impediment or Hindrance of a Descent from him  that did Homage to him that received it, seems to have heen yet  in Use, at least till 13 E. I. and in Fleta's Time, for he puts  the Case and admits it.      Secondly, Whereas both Bracton and Fleta agree, that half  Blood to him that is a Purchaser is an Impediment of a Descent  from the Common Ancestor, half Blood is no Impediment. As for  Instance; A. has Issue B. a Son and C. a Daughter by one Venter,  and D. a Son by another Venter: If B. purchases in Fee and dies  without Issue, it shall descend to the Sister, and not to the  Brother of the half Blood; but if the Land had descended from A.  to B. and he had entred and died without Issue, it was a Doubt in  Bracton and Britton's Time, whether it should go to the younger  Son, or to the Daughter? But the Law is since settled, that in  both Cases it descends to the Daughter, Et. seisina facit  Stipitem & Primum Gradum. Et Possessio Fratris de Feodo simplici  facit Sororem esse haeredem.      Thus upon the whole it seems, That abating those small and  inconsiderable Variances, the States and Rules of Descents as  they stood in the Time of Hen. 3, or at least in the Time of Edw.  I were reduced to their full Complement and Perfection, and vary  nothing considerably from what they are at this Day, and have  continued ever since that Time.      I shall therefore set down the State and Rule of Descents in  Fee-Simple as it stands at this Day, without meddling with  Particular Limitations of Entails of Estates, which vary the  Course of Descents in some Cases from the Common Rules of  Descents of hereditary Successions; and herein we shall see what  the Law has been and continued touching the same ever since  Bracton's Time, who wrote in the Time of Hen. 3. now above 400  Years since, and by that we shall see what Alterations the  Succession of Time has made therein.      And now to give a short Scheme of the Rules of Descents, or  hereditary Successions, of the Lands of Subjects as the Law  stands at this Day, and has stood for above four hundred Years  past, viz.      All possible hereditary Successions may be distinguished into  these 3 Kinds, viz, either,      1st, In the Descending Line, as from Father to Son or  Daughter, Nephew or Niece, i.e. Grandson or Grandaughter. Or,      2dly, ln the Collateral Line, as from Brother to Brother or  Sister, and so to Brother and Sisters Children. Or,      3dly, In an Ascending Line, either direct, as from Son to  Father or Grandfather, (which is not admitted by the Law of  England) or in the transversal Line, as to the Uncle or Aunt,  Great-Uncle or Great-Aunt, &c. And because this Line is again  divided into the Line of the Father, or the Line of the Mother,  this transverse ascending Succession is either in the Line of the  Father, Grandfather, &c. on the Blood of the Father; or in the  Line of the Mother, Grandmother, &c. on the Blood of the Mother:  The former are called Agnati, the latter Cognati: I shall  therefore set down a Scheme of Pedigrees as high as  Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmothers Grandsires, and as low  as Great-Grandchild; which nevertheless will be applicable to  more remote Successions with a little Variation, and will explain  the whole Nature of Descents or hereditary Successions.      This Pedigree, with its Application, will give a plain  Account of all Hereditary Successions under their several Cases  and Limitations, as will appear by the following Rules, taking  our Mark or Epocha from the FATHER and MOTHER.      But first, I shall premise certain general Rules, which will  direct us much in the Course of Descents as they stand here in  England: (Viz.)        First. In Descents, the Law prefers the Worthiest of Blood:  As,      1st, In all Descents immediate, the Male is preferred before  the Female, whether in Successions Descending, Ascending, or  Collateral: Therefore in Descents, the Son inherits and excludes  the Daughter, the Brother is preferred before the Sister, the  Uncle before the Aunt.      2dly, In all Descents immediate, the Descendants from Males  are to be preferred before the Descendants from Females: And  hence it is, That the Daughter of the eldest Son is preferred in  Descents from the Father before the Son of the younger Son; and  the Daughter of the eldest Brother, or Uncle, is preferred before  the Son of the younger; and the Uncle, nay, the Great-Uncle, i.e.  the Grandfather's Brother, shall inherit before the Uncle of the  Mothers Side.        Secondly, In Descents, the next of Blood is preferred before  the more remote, tho' equally or more worthy. And hence it is,      1st, The Sister of the whole Blood is preferred in Descents  before the Brother of the half Blood, because she is more  strictly joined to the Brother of the whole Blood (viz. by Father  and by Mother) than the half Brother, though otherwise he is the  more worthy.      2dly, Because the Son or Daughter being nearer than the  Brother, and the Brother or Sister than the Uncle, the Son or  Daughter shall inherit before the Brother or Sister, and they  before the Uncle.      3dly, That yet the Father or Grandfather, or Mother or  Grandmother, in a direct ascending Line, shall never succeed  immediately the Son or Grandchild; but the Father's Brother (or  Sisters) shall be preferred before the Father himself; and the  Grandfather's Brother (or Sisters) before the Grandfather: And  yet upon a strict Account, the Father is nearer of Blood to the  Son than the Uncle, yea than the Brother; for the Brother is  therefore of the Blood of the Brother, because both derive from  the same Parent, the Common Fountain of both their Blood. And  therefore the Father at this Day is preferred in the  Administration of the Goods before the Son's Brother of the whole  Blood, and a Remainder limited Proximo de Sanguine of the Son  shall vest in the Father before it shall vest in the Uncle. Vide  Littleton, Lib. I. fol. 8, 10.        Thirdly, That all the Descendants from such a Person as by  the Laws of England might have been Heir to another, hold the  same Right by Representation as that Common Root f rom whence  they are derived; and therefore,      1st, They are in Law in the same Right of Worthiness and  Proximity of Blood, as their Root that might have been Heir was,  in case he had been living: And hence it is, that the Son or  Grandchild, whether Son or Daughter of the eldest Son, succeeds  before the younger Son; and the Son or Grandchild of the eldest  Brother, before the youngest Brother; and so through all the  Degrees of Succession, by the Right of Representation, the Right  of Proximity is transferred from the Root to the Branches, and  gives them the same Preference as the next and worthiest of  Blood.      2dly, This Right transferred by Representation is infinite  and unlimited in the Degrees of those that descend from the  Represented; for Filius the Son, the Nepos the Grandson, the  Abnepos the Great-Grandson, and so in infinitum enjoy the same  Privilege of Representation as those from whom they derive their  Pedigree lhave, whether it be in Descents Lineal, or Transversal;  and theref ore the Great-Grandchild of the eldest Brother,  whether it be Son or Daughter. shall be preferred before the  younger Brother, because tho' the Female be less worthy than the  Male, yet she stands in Right of Representation of the eldest  Brother, who was more worthy than the younger. And upon this  Account it is,      3dly, That if a Man have two Daughters, and the eldest dies  in the Life of the Father, leaving six Daughters, and then the  Father dies; the youngest Daughter shall have an equal Share with  the other six Daughters, because they stand in Representation and  Stead of their Mother, who could have had but a Moiety.        Fourthly, That hy the Law of England, without a special  Custom to the contrary, the eldest Son, or Brother, or Uncle,  excludes the younger; and the Males in an equal Degree do not all  inherit: But all the Daughters, whether by the same or divers  Venters, do inherit together to the Father, and all the Sisters  by the same Venter do inherit to the Brother.        Fifthly, That the last Seisin in any Ancestor, makes him, as  it were the Root of the Descent equally to many Intents as if he  had been a Purchaser; and therefore he that cannot, according to  the Rules of Descents, derive his Succession from him that was  left actually seised, tho' he might have derived it from some  precedent Ancestor, shall not inherit. And hence it is, That  where Lands descend to the eldest Son from the Father, and the  Son enters and dies without Issue, his Sister of the whole Blood  shall inherit as Heir to the Brother, and not the younger Son of  the half Blood, because he cannot be Heir to the Brother of the  half Blood: But if the eldest Son had survived the Father and  died before Entry, the youngest Son should inherit as Heir to the  Father, and not the Sister, because he is Heir to the Father that  was last actually seised. And hence it is, That tho' the Uncle is  preferred before the Father in Descents to the Son; yet if the  Uncle enter after the Death of the Son, and die without Issue,  the Father shall inherit to the Uncle, quia Seisina facit  Stipitem.        Sixthly, That whosoever derives a Title to any Land, must be  of the Blood to him that first purchased it: And this is the  Reason why, if the Son purchase Lands and dies without Issue, it  shall descend to the Heirs of the Part of the Father; and if he  has none, then to the Heirs on the Part of the Mother; because,  tho' the Son has both the Blood of the Father and of the Mother  in him, yet he is of the whole Blood of the Mother, and the  Consanguinity of the Mother are Consanguinei Cognati of the Son.      And of the other Side, if the Father had purchased Lands, and  it had descended to the Son, and the Son had died without Issue,  and without any Heir of the Part of the Father, it should never  have descended in the Line of the Mother, but escheated: For tho'  the Consanguinei of the Mother were the Consanguinei of the Son,  yet they were not of Consanguinity to the Father, who was the  Purchaser; but if there had been none of the Blood of the  Grandfather, yet it might have resorted to the Line of the  Grandmother, because her Consanguinei were as well of the Blood  of the Father, as the Mother's Consanguinity is of the Blood of  the Son: And consequently also, if the Grandfather had purchased  Lands, and they had descended to the Father, and from him to the  Son; if the Son had entred and died without Issue, his Father's  Brothers or Sisters, or their Descendants, or, for want of them,  his Great-Grandfather's Brothers or Sisters, or their  Descendants, or, for want of them, any of the Consanguinity of  the Great-Grandfather, or Brothers or Sisters of the  Great-Grandmother, or their Descendants, might have inherited,  for the Consanguinity of the Great-Grandmother was the  Consanguinity of the Grandfather; but none of the Line of the  Mother, or Grandmother, viz. the Grandfather's Wife, should have  inherited, for that they were not of the Blood of the first  Purchaser. And the same Rule e converso holds in Purchases in the  Line of the Mother or Grandmother, they shall always keep in the  same Line that the first Purchaser settled them in.      But it is not necessary, That he that inherits be always Heir  to the Purchaser; it is sufficient if he be of his Blood, and  Heir to him that was last seised. The Father purchases Lands  which descended to the Son, who dies without Issue, they shall  never descend to the Heir of the Part of the Son's Mother; but if  the Son's Grandmother has a Brother, and the Son's  Great-Grandmother hath a Brother, and there are no other Kindred,  they shall descend to the Grandmother's Brother; and yet if the  Father had died without Issue, his Grandmother's Brother should  have been preferred before his Mother's Brother, because the  former was Heir of the Part of his Father tho' a Female, and the  latter was only Heir of the Part of his Mother; but where the Son  is once seized and dies without Issue, his Grandmother's Brother  is to him Heir of the Part of his Father, and being nearer than  his Great Grandmother's Brother, is preferred in the Descent.      But Note, This is always intended so long as the Line of  Descent is not broken; for if the Son alien those Lands, and then  repurchase them again in Fee, now the Rules of Descents are to be  observ'd as if he were the original Purchaser, and as if it had  been in the Line of the Father or Mother.        Seventhly, In all Successions, as well in the Line  Descending, Transversal, or Ascending, the Line that is first  derived from a Male Root has always the Preference.        Instances whereof in the Line Descending, &c. viz.      A. has Issue two Sons B. and C. B. has Issue a Son and a  Daughter D. and E. D. the Son has Issue a Daughter F. and E. the  Daughter has Issue a Son G. Neither C. nor any of his  Descendants, shall inherit so long as there are any Descendants  from D. and E. and neither E. the Daughter, nor any of her  Descendants, shall inherit so long as there are any Descendants  from D. the Son, whether they be Male or Female.      So in Descents Collateral, as Brothers and Sisters, the same  Instances apply'd thereto, evidence the same Conclusions.      But in Successions in the Line Ascending, there must be a  fuller Explication; because it is darker and more obscure, I  shall therefore set forth the whole Method of Transversal  Ascending Descents under the Eight ensuing Rules, viz.        First, If the Son purchases Lands in Fee-Simple, and dies  without Issue, those of the Male Line ascending, usque infinitum  shall be preferred in the Descent, according to their Proximity  of Degree to the Son; and therefore the Father's Brothers and  Sisters and their Descendants shall be preferred before the  Brothers, of the Grandfather and their Descendants; and if the  Father had no Brothers nor Sisters, the Grandfather's Brothers  and their Descendants, and for want of Brothers, his Sisters and  their Descendants, shall be preferr'd before the Brothers of the  Great Grandfather: For altho' by the Law of England the Father or  Grandfather cannot immediately inherit to the Son, yet the  Direction of the Descent to the Collateral Ascending Line, is as  much as if the Father or Grandfather had been by Law inheritable;  and therefore as in Case the Father had been inheritable, and  should have inherited to the Son before the Grandfather, and the  Grandfather, before the Great-Grandfather, and consequently if  the Father had inherited and died without Issue, his eldest  Brother and his Descendants should have inherited before the  younger Brother and his Descendants; and if he had no Brothers  but Sisters, the Sisters and their Descendants should have  inherited before his Uncles or the Grandfather's Brothers and  their Descendants. So though the Law of England excludes the  Father from inheriting, yet it substitutes and directs the  Descent as it should have been, had the Father inherited, viz. It  lets in those first that are in the next Degree to him.        Secondly, The second Rule is this: That the Line of the Part  of the Mother shall never inherit as long as there are any, tho'  never so remote, of the Line of the Part of the Father; and  therefore, tho' the Mother has a Brother, yet if the Atavus or  Atavia Patris (i. e. the Great-Great-Great-Grandfather, or  Great-Great-Great-Grandmother of the Father) has a Brother or a  Sister, he or she shall be preferred, and exclude the Mother's  Bother, though he is much nearer.        Thirdly, But yet further. The Male Line of the Part of the  Father ascending, shall in AEternum exclude the Female Line of  the Part of the Father ascending; and therefore in the Case  proposed of the Son's purchasing Lands and dying without Issue,  the Sister of the Father's Grandfather, or of his  Great-Grandfather, and so in infinitum shall be preferred before  the Father's Mother's Brother, tho' the Father's Mother's Brother  be a Male, and the Father's Grandfather or Great-Grandfather's  Sister be a Female, and more remote, because she is of the Male  Line, which is more worthy than the Female Line, though the  Female Line, be also of the Blood of the Father.        Fourthly, But as in the Male Line ascending, the more near is  preferred before the more remote; so in the Female Line  descending, so it be of the Blood of the Father, it is preferred  before the more remote. The Son, therefore purchasing Lands, and  dying without Issue, and the Father, Grandfather, and  Great-Grandfather, and so upward, all the Male Line being dead  without any Brother or Sister, or any descending from them; but  the Father's Mother has a Sister or Brother, and also the  Father's Grandmother has a Brother, and likewise the Father's  GreatGrandmother has a Brother: Tho' it is true, that all these  are of the Blood of the Father; and tho' the very remotest of  them, shall exclude the Son's Mother's Brother; and tho' it be  also true, that the Great-Grandmother's Blood has passed through  more Males of the Father's Blood than the Blood of the  Grandmother or Mother of the Father; yet in this Case, the  Father's Mother's Sister shall be preferred before the Father's  Grandmother's Brother, or the Great Grandmother's Brother,  because they are all in the Female Line, viz. Cognati (and not  Agnati), and the Father's Mother's Sister is the nearest, and  therefore shall have the Preference as well as in the Male Line  ascending, the Father's Brother or his Sister shall he preferred  before the Grandfather's Brother.        Fifthly, But yet in the last Case, where the Son purchases  Lands and dies without Issue, and without any Heir on the Part of  the Grandfather, the Lands shall descend to the Grandmother's  Brother or Sister, as Heir on the Part of his Father; yet if the  Father had purchased this Land and died, and it descended to his  Son who died without Issue, the Lands should not have descended  to the Father's Mother's Brother or Sister, for the Reasons  before given in the Third Rule: But for want of Brothers or  Sisters of the Grandfather, Great-Grandfather, and so upwards in  the Male ascending Line, it should descend to the Father's  Grandmother's Brother or Sister which is his Heir of the Part of  his Father, who should be preferred before the Father's Mother's  Brother, who is in Truth the Heir of the Part of the Mother of  the Purchaser, tho' the next Heir of the Part of the Father of  him that last died seized; and therefore, as if the Father that  was the Purchaser had died without Issue, the Heirs of the Part  of the Father, whether of the Male or Female Line, should have  been preferred before the Heirs of the Part of the Mother; so the  Son, who stands now in the Place of the Father, and inherits to  him primarily, in his Father's Line, dying without Issue, the  same Devolution and hereditary Succession should have been as if  his Father had immediately died without Issue, which should have  been to his Grandmother's Brother, as Heir of the Part of the  Father, though by the Female Line, and not to his Mother's  Brother, who was only Heir of the Part of his Mother, and who is  not to take till the Father's Line both Male and Female be spent.        Sixthly, If the Son purchases Lands and died without Issue,  and it descends to any Heir of the Part of the Father, and then  if the Line of the Father (after Entry and Possession) fail, it  shall never return to the Line of the Mother; tho' in the first  Instance, or first Descent from the Son, it might have descended  to the Heir of the Part of the Mother; for now by this Descent  and Seisin it is lodged in the Father's Line, to whom the Heir of  the Part of the Mother can never derive a Title as Heir, but it  shall rather escheat: But if the Heir of the Part of the Father  had not entred, and then that Line had failed, it might have  descended to the Heir of the Part of the Mother as Heir to the  Son, to whom immediately, for want of Heirs of the Part of the  Father, it might have descended.        Seventhly, And upon the same Reason, if it had once descended  to the Heir of the Part of the Father of the Grandfather's Line,  and that Heir had entred, it should never descend to the Heir of  the Part of the Father of the Grandmother's Line, because the  Line of the Grandmother was not of the Blood or Consanguinity of  the Line of the Grandfather's Side.        Eighthly, If for Default of Heirs of the Purchaser of the  Part of the Father, the Lands descend to the Line of the Mother,  the Heirs of the Mother of the Part of her Father's Side, shall  be preferred in the Succession before her Heirs of the Part of  her Mother's Side, because they are the more worthy.        And thus the Law stands in Point of Descents or Hereditary  Successions in England at this Day, and has so stood and  continued for above four Hundred Years past, as by what has  before been said, may easily appear. And Note, The most Part of  the Eight Rules and Differences above specified and explained,  may be collected out of the Resolutions in the Case of Clare  versus Brook, &c. in Plowden's Commentaries, Folio 444.    XII. Touching Trials by Jury        Having in the former Chapter somewhat largely treated of the  Course of Descents, I shall now with more Brevity consider that  other Title of our Law which I before propounded (in order to  evidence the Excellency of the Laws of England above those of  other Nations,) viz. The Trial by a Jury of Twelve Men; which  upon all Accounts, as it is settled here in this Kingdom, seems  to be the best Trial in the World: I shall therefore give a short  Account of the Method and Manner of that Trial, viz.        First, The Writ to return a Jury, issues to the Sheriff of  the County: And,      1st, He is to be a Person of Worth and Value, that so he may  be responsible for any Defaults, either of himself or his  Officers. And, 2dly, Is sworn, faithfully and honestly to execute  his Office. This Officer is entrusted to elect and return the  Jury, which he is obliged to do in this Manner: 1. Without the  Nomination of either Party. 2. They are to be such Persons as for  Estate and Quality are fit to serve upon that Employment. 3. They  are to be of the Neighbourhood of the Fact to be inquired, or at  least of the County or Bailywick. And, 4. Anciently Four, and now  Two of them at least are to be of the Hundred. But Note, This is  now in great Measure altered by Statute.      Secondly, Touching the Number and Qualifications of the Jury.      1st, As to their Number, though only Twelve are sworn, yet  Twenty-four are to be returned to supply the Defects or Want of  Appearance of those that are challenged off, or make Default.  2dly, Their Qualifications are many, and are generally set down  in the Writ that summons them, viz. 1. They are to be Probi &  legales Homines. 2. Of sufficient Freeholds, according to several  Provisions of Acts of Parliament. 3. Not Convict of any notorious  Crime that may render them unfit for that Employment. 4. They are  not to be of the Kindred or Alliance of any of the Parties. And,  5. Not to be such as are prepossed or prejudiced before they hear  their Evidence.      Thirdly, The Time of their Return.      Indeed, in Assizes, the Jury is to be ready at the Bar the  first Day of the Return of the Writ: But in other Cases, the  Pannel is first returned upon the Venire Facias, or ought to be  so, and the Proofs or Witnesses are to be brought or summoned by  Distringas or Habeas Corpora for their Appearance at the Trial,  whereby the Parties may have Notice of the Jurors, and of their  Sufficiency and Indifferency, that so they may make their  Challenges upon the Appearance of the Jurors if there be just  Cause.      Fourthly, The Place of their Appearance.      If it be in Cases of such Weight and Consequence as by the  Judgment of the Court is fit to be tried at the Bar, then their  Appearance is directed to be there; but in ordinary Cases, the  Place of Appearance is in the Country at the Assizes, or Nisi  Prius, in the County where the Issue to be tried arises: And  certainly this is an excellent Constitution. The great Charge of  Suits is the Attendance of the Parties, the Jury-Men and  Witnesses: And therefore tho' the Preparation of the Causes in  Point of pleading to Issue, and the Judgment, is for the most  Part in the Courts at Westminster, whereby there is kept a great  Order and Uniformity of Proceedings in the whole Kingdom, to  prevent Multiplicity of Laws and Forms; yet those are but of  small Charge, or Trouble, or Attendance, one Attorney being able  to dispatch forty Mens Business with the same Ease, and no  greater Attendance than one Man would dispatch his own Business:  But the great Charge and Attendance is at the Trial, which is  therefore brought Home to the Parties in the Countries, and for  the most Part near where they live.      Fifthly, The Persons before whom they are to appear.      If the Trial be at the Bar, it is to be before that Court  where the Trial is; if in the Country, then before the Justices  of Assizes, or Nisi Prius, who are Persons well acquainted with  the Common Law, and for the most Part are Two of those Twelve  ordinary Justices who are appointed for the Common Dispensation  of Justice in the Three great Courts at Westminster. And this  certainly was a most wise Constitution: For      1st, It prevents Factions and Parties in the Carriage of  Business, which would soon appear in every Cause of Moment, were  the Trial only before Men residing in the Counties, as Justices  of the Peace, or the like, or before Men of little or no Place,  Countenance or Preheminence above others; and the more to prevent  Partiality in this Kind, those Judges are by Law prohibited to  hold their Sessions in Counties where they were born or dwell.      2dly, As it prevents Factions and Part-takings, so it keeps  both the Rule and the Administration of the Laws of the Kingdom  uniform; for those Men are employed as Justices, who as they have  had a Common Education in the Study of the Law, so they daily in  Term-time converse and consult with one another; acquaint one  another with their Judgments, sit near one another in  Westminster-Hall, whereby their Judgments and Decisions are  necessarily communicated to one another, either immediately or by  Relations of others, and by this Means their Judgments and their  Administrations of Common Justice carry a Consonancy, Congruity  and Uniformity one to another, whereby both the Laws and the  Administrations thereof are preserved from that Confusion and  Disparity that would unavoidably ensue, if the Administration was  by several incommunicating Hands, or by provincial  Establishments: And besides all this, all those Judges are  solemnly sworn to observe and judge according to the Laws of the  Kingdom, according to the best of their Knowledge and  Understanding.      Sixthly, When the Jurors appear, and are called, each Party  has Liberty to take his Challenge to the Array itself, if unduly  or partially made by the Sheriff; or if the Sheriff be of Kin to  either Party, or to the Polls, either for Insufficiency of  Freehold, or Kindred or Alliance to the other Party, or such  other Challenges, either Principal, or to the Favour, as renders  the Juror unfit and incompetent to try the Cause, and the  Challenge being confess'd or found true by some of the rest of  the Jury, that particular incompetent Person is withdrawn.      Seventhly, Then Twelve, and no less, of such as are  indifferent and are return'd upon the principal Pannel, or the  Tales, are sworn to try the same according to their Evidence.      Eighthly, Being thus sworn, the Evidence on either Part is  given in upon the Oath of Witnesses, or other Evidence by Law  allowed, (as Records and ancient Deeds, but later Deeds and  Copies of Records must be attested by the Oaths of Witnesses) and  other Evidence in the open Court, and in the Presence of the  Parties, their Attornies, Council and all By-standers, and before  the Judge and Jury, where each Party has Liberty of excepting,  either to the Competency of the Evidence, or the Competency or  Credit of the Witnesses, which Exceptions are publickly stated,  and by the Judges openly or publickly allowed or disallowed,  wherein if the Judge be partial, his Partiality and Injustice  will be evident to all By-standers; and if in his Direction or  Decision he mistake the Law, either through Partiality,  Ignorance, or Inadvertency, either Party may require him to seal  a Bill of Exception, thereby to deduce the Error of the Judge (if  any were) to a due Ratification or Reversal by Writ of Error.      Ninthly, The Excellency of this open Course of Evidence to  the Jury in Presence of the Judge, Jury, Parties and Council, and  even of the adverse Witnesses, appears in these Particulars:      1st, That it is openly; and not in private before a  Commissioner or Two, and a couple of Clerks, where oftentimes  Witnesses will deliver that which they will be ashamed to testify  publickly.      2dly, That it is Ore Tenus personally, and not in Writing,  wherein oftentimes, yea too often, a crafty Clerk, Commissioner,  or Examiner, will make a Witness speak what he truly never meant,  by his dressing of it up in his own Terms, Phrases, and  Expressions; whereas on the other Hand, many times the very  Manner of a Witness's delivering his Testimony will give a  probable Indication whether he speaks truly or falsly. and by  this Means also he has Opportunity to correct, amend, or explain  his Testimony upon further Questioning with him, which he can  never have after a Deposition is set down in Writing.      3dly, That by this Course of personal and open Examination,  there is Opportunity for all Persons concern'd, viz. The Judge,  or any of the Jury, or Parties, or their Council or Attornies, to  propound occasional Questions, which beats and boults out the  Truth much better than when the Witness only delivers a formal  Series of his Knowledge without being interrogated; and on the  other Side, preparatory, limited, and formal Interrogatories in  Writing, preclude this Way of occasional Interrogations, and the  best Method of searching and sifting out the Truth is choak'd and  suppress'd.      4thly, Also by this personal Appearance and Testimony of  Witnesses, there is Opportunity of confronting the adverse  Witnesses, of observing the Contradiction of Witnesses sometimes  of the same Side, and by this Means great Opportunities are  gained for the true and clear Discovery of the Truth.      5thly, And further, The very Quality, Carriage, Age,  Condition, Education, and Place of Commorance of Witnesses, is by  this Means plainly and evidently set forth to the Court and the  Jury, whereby the Judge and Jurors may have a full Information of  them, and the Jurors, as they see Cause, may give the more or  less Credit to their Testimony, for the Jurors are not only  Judges of the Fact, but many Times of the Truth of Evidence; and  if there be just Cause to disbelieve what a Witness swears, they  are not bound to give their Verdict according to the Evidence or  Testimony of that Witness; and they may sometimes give Credit to  one Witness, tho' oppos'd by more than one. And indeed, it is one  of the Excellencies of this Trial above the Trial by Witnesses,  that altho' the Jury ought to give a great Regard to Witnesses  and their Testimony, yet they are not always bound by it, but may  either upon reasonable Circumstances, inducing a Blemish upon  their Credibility, tho, otherwise in themselves in Strictness of  Law they are to be heard, pronounce a Verdict contrary to such  Testimonies, the Truth whereof they have just Cause to suspect,  and may and do often pronounce their Verdict upon one single  Testimony, which Thing the Civil Law admits not of.      Tenthly, Another Excellency of this Trial is this; That the  Judge is always present at the Time of the Evidence given in it:  Herein he is able in Matters of Law emerging upon the Evidence to  direct them; and also, in Matters of Fact, to give them a great  Light and Assistance by his weighing the Evidence before them,  and observing where the Question and Knot of the Business lies,  and by shewing them his Opinion even in Matter of Fact, which is  a great Advantage and Light to Lay-Men: And thus, as the Jury  assists the Judge in determining the Matter of Fact, so the Judge  assists the Jury in determining Points of Law, and also very much  in investigating and enlightning the Matter of Fact, whereof the  Jury are Judges.      Eleventhly, When the Evidence is fully given, the Jurors  withdraw to a private Place, and are kept from all Speech with  either of the Parties till their Verdict is delivered up, and  from receiving any Evidence other than in open Court, where it  may be search'd into, discuss'd and examin'd. In this Recess of  the Jury they are to consider their Evidence, and if any Writings  under Seal were given in Evidence, they are to have with them;  they are to weigh the Credibility of Witnesses, and the Force and  Efficacy of their Testimonies, wherein (as I before said) they  are not precisely bound to the Rules of the Civil Law, viz. To  have two Witnesses to prove every Fact, unless it be in Cases of  Treason, nor to reject one Witness because he is single, or  always to believe Two Witnesses if the Probability of the Fact  does upon other Circumstances reasonably encounter them; for the  Trial is not here simply by Witnesses, but by Jury; nay, it may  so fall out, that the Jury upon their own Knowledge may know a  Thing to be false that a Witness swore to be true, or may know a  Witness to be incompetent or incredible, tho' nothing be objected  against him, and may give their Verdict accordingly.      Twelfthly, When the whole Twelve Men are agreed, then, and  not till then, is their Verdict to be received; and therefore the  Majority of Assentors does not conclude the Minority, as is done  in some Countries where Trials by Jury are admitted: But if any  one of the Twelve dissent, it is no Verdict, nor ought to be  received. It is true, That in ancient Times, as Hen. 2 and Hen.  3's Time, yea, and by Fleta in the Beginning of Edw. I's Time, if  the Jurors dissented, sometimes there was added a Number equal to  the greater Party, and they were then to give up their Verdict by  Twelve of the old Jurors, and the Jurors so added; but this  Method has been long Time antiquated, notwithstanding the  Practice in Bracton's Time, lib. 4. cap. 9. and Fleta, lib. 4.  cap. 9. for at this Day the entire Number first empanell'd and  sworn are to give up an unanimous Verdict, otherwise it is none.  And indeed this gives a great Weight, Value and Credit to such a  Verdict, wherein Twelve Men must unanimously agree in a Matter of  Fact, and none dissent; though it must be agreed, that an  ignorant Parcel of Men are sometimes governed by a few that are  more knowing, or of greater Interest or Reputation than the rest.      Thirteenthly, But if there be Matter of Law that carries in  it any Difficulty, the Jury may, to deliver themselves from the  Danger of an Attaint, find it specially, that so it may be  decided in that Court where the Verdict is returnable; and if the  Judge overrule the Point of Law contrary to Law, whereby the Jury  are perswaded to find a general Verdict (which yet they are not  bound to do, if they doubt it,) then the Judge, upon the Request  of the Party desiring it, is bound by Law in convenient Time to  seal a Bill of Exceptions, containing the whole Matter excepted  to; that so the Party grieved, by such Indiscretion or Error of  the Judge, may have Relief by Writ of Error on the Statute of  Westminster 2.      Fourteenthly, Altho' upon general Verdicts given at the Bar  in the Courts at Westminster, the Judgment is given within Four  Days, in Presumption that there cannot be any considerable  Surprise in so solemn a Trial, or at least it may be soon espied;  yet upon Trials by Nisi prius in the Country, the Judgment is not  given presently by the Judge of Nisi prius, unless in Cases of  Quare Impedits: But the Verdict is returned after Trial into that  Court from whence the Cause issued, that thereby, if any Surprise  happened either through much Business of the Court, or through  Inadvertency of the Attorney or Council, or through any  Miscarriage of the Jury, or through any other Casualty, the Party  may have his Redress in that Court from whence the Record issued.      And thus stands this excellent Order of Trial by Jury, which  is far beyond the Trial by Witnesses according to the Proceedings  of the Civil Law, and of the Courts of Equity, both for the  Certainty, the Dispatch, and the Cheapness thereof: It has all  the Helps to investigate the Truth that the Civil Law has, and  many more. For as to Certainty,        1st, It has the Testimony of Witnesses, as well as the Civil  Law and Equity Courts.      2dly, It has this Testimony in a much more advantageous Way  than those Courts for Discovery of Truth.      3dly, It has the Advantage of the Judge's Observation,  Attention, and Assistance, in Point of Law by way of Decision,  and in Point of Fact by way of Direction to the Jury.      4thly, It has the Advantage of the Jury, and of their being  de Vicineto, who oftentimes know the Witnesses and the Parties:  And,      5thly, It has the unanimous Suffrage and Opinion of Twelve  Men, which carries in itself a much greater Weight and  Preponderation to discover the Truth of a Fact, than any other  Trial whatsoever.        And as this Method is more certain, so it is much more  expeditious and cheap; for oftentimes the Session of one  Commission for the Examination of Witnesses for one Cause in the  Ecclesiastical Courts, or Courts of Equity, lasts as long as a  whole Session of Nisi prius, where a Hundred Causes are examined  and tried.      And thus much concerning Trials in Civil Causes. As for  Trials in Causes Criminal, they have this further Advantage, That  regularly the Accusation, as preparatory to the Trial, is by a  Grand Jury: So that as no Man's Interest, according to the Course  of the Common Law, is to be tried or determined without the Oaths  of a Jury of twelve Men; so no Man's Life is to be tried but by  the Oaths of Twelve Men, and by the Preparatory Accusation or  Indictment by Twelve Men or more precedent to his Trial, unless  it be in the Case of an Appeal at the Suit of the Party.
